12-07-2021#ThursdayBlackness: Olaolowa Osatokun&nbsp;Hola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's #raisedfist and now #handclapps are for Laolu aka #RoastBeef. Yes, that's his real handle for @Twitter. I'd like to talk with him one day and hear the story behind.&nbsp;I made it a point to try and say his actual name. I noticed in a number of interviews no one says his full. You'll know how bad I am with names, lol.Nonetheless, if you ever read this post. I'd like to say thank you for what your doing in the space. Your work on the #LightningNetwork with your company @lightniglabs. And a special thanks you for proving that black people are more consumers. We are innovators, Influencers, and creators.Also, I like to say thanks to the folks out there who helped getting the list to grow. As you see in the vlog, it's 200 names.&nbsp; Can't wait to see what it looks like at the end of 2021.#Trekkw2Ks #BlacksInBlockchain #2layer #PoverB
