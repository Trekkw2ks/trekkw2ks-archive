8-25-2020Tuesday Brand: Who's In the Crowd?Hola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's vlog is based on a few conversations I've had over the last few months with startups founders.There is 1 question I ask everyone at some point in the conversation. I've had more than 1 person reply with 1 specific word. I see this as a growing problem in the blockchain space.So, today's focus on is building a businessbrand and what sits at the core of it.What's that you ask?Picture this, we are standing at a popular area in your city, people watching. And yes this is pre-covid, which means people are out and about.&nbsp;Sorry, but the question and answer are in the vid, lol.hhimtrekk tuesdaybrand knowingtheaudience realtalk speackingtheirlanguage brandbuilding brandlanguage branddevelopment delayedtuesday #2020aintready PoverB ThinkersnDoers
