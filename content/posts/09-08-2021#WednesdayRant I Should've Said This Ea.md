09-08-2021#WednesdayRant: I Should've Said This EarlierHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,So today I have no rant. But this is more of a invite that I should've put out earlier today.If you in #Baltimore around 5pm, come join me and @samson and who ever else shows up for a pop up #pophour @ R.House. Don't worry googly knows where it is.We'll talk about #crowdfunding (Samson's fav subject), prob some crypto stuff like why Bitcoin is religions, and the market manipulation taken place in the Ethereum ecosystem.But I make no promises.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #popups
