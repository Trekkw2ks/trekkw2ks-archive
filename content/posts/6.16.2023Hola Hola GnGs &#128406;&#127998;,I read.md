6.16.2023Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,I read a post on #Twitter today (a responce to post about crypto) that said "People want mass adoption."I repsonded with "thats not a people thing, it's a marketing phrase. People don't care about mass adoption."The rest of the thought (not typed out) was if &#128169; could work as monetary medium the whole narrative around it would change and people would walk around with a satchel of poop. For those who think that's crazy, remember in history various societies used rocks, seashells, and salt a money. And we can't forget the use of humans in bartering for goods and services. Too crazy&#129335;&#127997;&zwj;♂️?But anywho about this #TwitterSpaces last night hosted by 3D and myself on the #BuildRDAO account. Oh and before I forget, the name of our weekly live segment is called Metaverses: The Other Side.Last night's episode was titled "The internet is disappearing. Will the same thing happen to #Metaverses? It has been a offline topic for us for a number of years. The basic takeaway is the web1.0 upgraded from just text to 2.0 adding&nbsp; pictures and audio on websites. Web3's talking points are centered around a imersive experience, which means more enriched data that has to be stored and maintained somewhere. The &#128024; in the room is where do you store it and how long do you maintain it for all the digital assets (#NFTs, #PFPs, avatars, etc) inside that #virtualreality aka a metaverse?We believe metaverses will follow the same narrative as websites did back in the early 2000s. But more importantly, the storage technology will follow the same design implementation of the current internet. Centralization and siloism will continue to be the market standard (ie #AWS #Azura). Which is where most people will build for the lowered technical barrier to entry and convienece.So at some point down the road, users will lose access to items in The Sandbox and Second Life. Tech companies discontinue supporting hardware and software all the time. There's a number of reason for the expanding degradation of the internet. There was a buyout, the service provider changed or upped the price,&nbsp; the company went under or its not getting the traffic it use to.Metaverses will not be immune.Just because it's digital, it doesn't mean it last forever. And it's largely dependent on how your storage is build. The irony is that's contrary to how people generally understand digital storage.BTW, here is the YouTube vid that brought our convo to Spaces: link.But anywho, the takeaway is nothing last forever. Whether it's games, websites, money systems, or even life; at some point things end.P.S.
