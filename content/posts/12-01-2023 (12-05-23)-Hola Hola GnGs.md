12.01.23 (12.05.23)Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,&nbsp;I think someone just opened up a can of worms regarding #CopyRight protections for #AiGeneratedArt by reframing what #HumanAuthorship means.&nbsp;Unfortunately, for creators in the west this was a Beijing Internet court case.That court went opposite of the #ZaryaofDawn and Thaler v Perlmutter deMarket? Giving favor to Mr Lui's copyright protection for his Ai generated artwork.Which brings me to the question of the day, whose court will be thr first to give AI direct copyright protection, the east or west?&nbsp;And in case your were wondering, here's the crypto connection. Will this help or hurt the degen #NFT market?Honestly, IDK &#129335;&#127998;&zwj;♂️,&nbsp; lol.However, I imagine that part of the #cryptomovie will be filled with interesting scams, hacks, and degens basking in their 15 of fame.Case details &#128071;&#127999;link#Trekkw2ks #StableDifussion #PoverB #ChineseCourt&nbsp; #USCopyOfficePS: Get your &#127871;&nbsp; n VR glasses ready for the coming shit show of &#128008; and &#128001;&nbsp; regulators and anyone touching NFTs.
