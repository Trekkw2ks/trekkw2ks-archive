12.03.25Original:Hola Hola G&amp;Gs &#128406;&#127998;,Today, I'm talking a whole chapter out of Samson Williams book for creating content for Linkedin. I present a question to the more degreed, techie, and seasoned veterans of the LinkedIn crypto community.When you first read the title of the #BitcoinWhitePaper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", what did you interpret it to mean?&nbsp;This question is based on a comment in a post by Kimi about&nbsp;"Bitcoin&rsquo;s PE ratio over time&rdquo;. Again, Partick, I appreciate you taking the time to joist wet noodles with me verbally.&nbsp;For those seeking more context and the original post, here is Kimi's original post:&nbsp;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kimi-wussow_i-saw-a-chart-yesterday-comparing-bitcoin-activity-7399208575102812160-rKhU.georgePatrick Van EschKimi Wussowjoseph usoAmberkeir tamara#Trekkw2ks #ScratchMyBrain #Bitcoin #Crypto
