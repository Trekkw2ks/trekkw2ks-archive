7-22-2020Wednesday Rant: It Still Surprises Me.Hola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's vlog is based on a experience i had last during the Blockchain &amp; Booze event held for the ReUp of @crypto blockchain plug.&nbsp;Shout out outs to the ThinkersandDo on the panel @ta @atonio @saritt @ naj @cheree. But i degrease.So, during the networking, someone reached to talk because they followed my vlogs and wanted to talk. After 2+ yrs of making digitalcontent,it still surprise and humbles me when someone says they know my stuff.The point is I'm not out here trying to be mister popular to be kool. For the folks who do follow my content and those who reach out to build rapport.Thank you, I appreciate the positive vibes.hhimtrekk wednesday SoMe&nbsp; contentcreator takeaction networking blockchainnBooze thankyou humbled entreprenuerrealtalk blacksintech
