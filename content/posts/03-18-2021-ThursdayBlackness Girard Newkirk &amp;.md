03-18-2021#ThursdayBlackness: Girard Newkirk &amp; Tamika Leverette-McCallHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's raised fist and hand claps go to Girard Newkirk and Tamika Leverette-McCall. Yep, it's a two for one.Sorry for being a day late but here it is.&nbsp;Kwhcoin was founded back in 2017 by Girard and Tamika with the goal of connecting renewable energy and cryptocurrency. The energy sector as a whole is a very capital intensive industry to get in. Not to mention having the connection.But I have to say hats off to Tamika and Girard for their doing their part to help make a the world a better place.I hope one day we can meet and I can hear about what you've learned in crossing the two industries.#Trekkw2ks #PoverB #ThinkersnDoers #womenshistorymonthPosted 03/19/2021
