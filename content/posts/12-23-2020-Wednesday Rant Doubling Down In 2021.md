12-23-2020Wednesday Rant: Doubling Down In 2021Hola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,So, I'm not sure if I should count this as a announcement or a heads up. But today vlog is about me doubling down on the content I put out in 2021.Some of were annoyed with me in 2020. People even said stop tagging them. Ironically, others asked me to tag them in stuff. Nonetheless, I'll be changing that and some other things going forward.I gave a sneak peek of my new vlogs intros to some people. The responces were better than expected. Still a few more tweeks but I'm zagging in 2021 while most will still zig.Also, I'm going to start doing interviews again for the podcast TrekkenCryptos2Connet. I'm serious when I say I want to talk with everyone in the company. Founders and CEOs are not the only ones that matter.Any who, I get more into what's to come in the vlog.&nbsp;hhimtrekk WednesdayRant ebook BrandEcho SGTTrekk YouTube ContentCreation #2021IsAlmostHere DoubleDown ThinkersnDoers PoverB Podcast
