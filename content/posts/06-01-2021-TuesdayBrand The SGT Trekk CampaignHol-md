06-01-2021#TuesdayBrand: The SGT Trekk CampaignHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998; &#128187;&#128242;,Today's vlog is a little insight into how I'm getting the word out about my #ebook SGT Trekk: Life After AIT, When The Real Shit Starts.&nbsp;I'm basically pushing across SoMe (social media), but with out doing any paid ads. Over the weekend, I made a few new posters and vids. The idea is to see what gets traction. In the vlog I give more details about the posts. I'll also be doing more live streams.The takeaway, it's all trial and error.&nbsp; If you're not willing to make mistakes and learn from your mistakes, then get ready to waste a shit ton of money.Last thing, you can download the ebook from @amazon @ Bit./ly/sgttrekkebook#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #SgtTrekk #ArmyCareer #LifeAfterAIT
