8--2019Emo ActionsThis #MondyPush is based on what happen to me last night/this morning.&nbsp;If you know anything about the 03 #hondapilet, it was all about the #keys. 1 to start, 1 to open the door, n another for the glove box. In short I lost the 1 to start it.What does this have to do with totally my made up phrase #emoactions?Simple, life is going to throw things at you that will get you to act based off emotions. Which can either make your situation worst or be a totally waste of energy and resources.&nbsp;Odds are someone out there needs to hear this (not just the #entrepreneurs) because something(s) has happen that really has you in your feeling or panicking on what to.Bottomline, emotions and business don't mix.&nbsp; Remember that going into this wk. Don't let life distract you. Think things through before taking action.Ask for advice/help from your circle.-you can't have all the answers for every situation.I'm not just talking from conjecture or just to hear my voice. I'm talking to you from what's my life. This is the real of what my #Cryptolife is the good, the bad, and the ugly.If I can stay focused so can you.
