4-30-2020Thursday Blackness: Sope Williams&nbsp;Hola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's raisedfist and hat tips goes to @sope William's. She is the Deputy Director of African Procurement Law Unit @stellenbosch University.&nbsp;Yes her title carries some weight,&nbsp; but that isn't the reason I wanted to talk with her. She made a point on stage about using blockchain to help reduce corruption in the publicsector. And before it could be used effectively, the data must be collected.This is the understanding that tends to get overlooked, IMO. Just throwing money at a new project with buzzwords doesn't actually solve problems for people.I look for to see Sope progress in the space. Also thanks to @African us for bringing me to joburg and @bitcoin for BAC20202. I look forward to next year.hhimtrekk ThursdayBalckness southafrica blacksinblockchain procurment data realtalk publicblockchain PoverB ThinkersnDoers groundlevel&nbsp;
