03-12-2021#FridayFocus: Snail &amp; TurtleHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,&nbsp;Today's vlog is based on a #youtube video I was watching about #Akan proverbs. I swear the tube can be so distracting. I found a random video in my feed that some how got me That. The #rabbitwhole is real, lol.Any who, I heard this saying which actually involves a baby. At first it didn't make sense honestly. But then he explained it in practical term.Which of course made me think of entrepreneurship. I was definitely had a #fuzzybrain today. So I was kinda surprised I came up with this, lol.You'll see what I mean in the vlog.#Trekkw2ks #stilladjusting #ThinkernDoers #PoverB #Showingup
