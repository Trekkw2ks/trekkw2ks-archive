03-16-2021#TuesdayBrand: Talking Shyt About NFTsHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,So today's vlog is me dropping my two bits on the on the whole #NFT craze. That includes the #gateguards and analog thinking nay sayers.It took like 4 tries but I ran long each time, sorry.&nbsp;The bullet points are:1. New gate guards are positioning themselves.2. NFTs are being push in a narrative very similar to BTC back in the day. And I'm talking before 2017.The old&#128016;s get me.3. Art is just one use case of NFT technology.4. NFT ransoms will start before 2024. Hackers have influence on value.5. We are in a real time market discovery phase that will take more than one year to figure out.6. NFTs now make as much sense as email back in 1990.I made some more points but you'll have to watch the vlog to hear them.To my fellow entrepernuers. You DO NOT have to be an artist to be in the space. The art aspect is just one use caseI strongly recommend you start paying attention. More on why in the vlog.Samson, I'm waiting for you first NFT. Keir I think the value of your intellectual capital can expand beyond linkedin.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #Poverb #Checkin #CapitalFlight
