01-20-2021 WednesdayRant: The Decad Of Struggling Spe chHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on something I said about 20 years ago. Back in my early days of college, I would say I saw #FreedomofSpeech as a pretty simple concept to understand,&nbsp; believe in, and support.&nbsp;But even with that understand I was always worried about how that would be supported by technology going forward.And so here we are 20 years later. Today the US has ushered in the 46president Joe Biden. I do think the bigger moment is Kamal Harris being the #vicepresident. But I degrease.I'll cut to the point. IMO, this decade will present many a numbers of situation that show free speech is subjective to the whims of the #popularnarrative.#Trekkw2Ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #SupportWhat #NewDecade
