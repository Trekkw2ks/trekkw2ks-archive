Untitled Thursday Blackness  Hola hola G&amp;Gs, So I'm late in pushing this out put it's still worth the listen.  The other day, I had the chance to talk with Kim Weatherington my Trekken Cryptos 2 Connect podcast.  We talked about how she got into blockchain technology, how she started her cleaning business Genuine Care Home Services, and what got her to start a tech company Care Affiliates. Mind you she doesn't code. Yes, you can be in tech with out coding, lol.  I have to admit before this convo I had no idea how deep and lucrative the cleaningindustry was, over 2 billion globaly.  I bring her up today to as an example of a black person being in tech. She saw a need and is actively working to provide a blockchain based (hyperledger) solution to reduce the friction in her industry.  I honestly thing her story is amazing on so many levels.  I'll let you'll know when the episode gets posted. But this is just beginning of what I'm doing with ThursdayBlackness.  I'm looking for more people to talk with like Samson Williams Derrick Raphael Esq. Maureen L. Murat, Esq.
