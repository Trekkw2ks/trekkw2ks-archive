10-07-2020Wednesday Rant: I Got SocksHola Hola G&amp;Gs,Today's rant/ramble (I'm posting the shorter vlog, lol) is about something I heard Tyrone bring up in one of his livestreams on Twitter. And since I was out and today, I figured to share. I bought socks.&nbsp;To be clear, this may sound naive or simplistic to some. But for me "thanks" to unclesams&nbsp;travel plane. I know how important socks are. I'm not saying this helps everyone or once punches homelessness. But I know it will matter to someone. People are taking and giving here.So it doesn't hurt to add.hhimtrekk wednesdayrant realtalk feetmatter simplethings winter #2020aintready thinkersnDoers PoverB trekkw2ks&nbsp; montebellopark bmorelove&nbsp; &nbsp;
