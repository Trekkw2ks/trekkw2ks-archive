01-29-2021 FridayFocus: I Don't Want To Be An Entrepreneur AnymoreHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on a very long phone convo with a friend last night. Yes, I still talk to people on a &#128222;, lol.During the convo, the topic of entrepreneurship came up. Which is what lead to the title for today. As I've mentioned many times, I see entrepreneurship as a triathlon. And for my friend who is questioning their roll in life at the, it a big detergent.This made me think about the pump of everyone chasing their bream and as @samson calls it #vcporn.&nbsp;The point, being an entrepreneur is being promoted as something everyone should be. And I've been learning. That's not the case. I talk about it more in the vlog.#trekkw2ks&nbsp;#ThinnkersnDoers&nbsp;#PoverB #DontChaseDreams&nbsp;
