04-16-2021#FridayFocus: The Wind In SailsHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on a convo I had the other day. I've been waiting to talk with this person for a while. But our schedules never worked out.&nbsp;This week some how the stars aligned and it happened at the last minute.&nbsp;There were many takeaways for me. The main one is what the sub-caption is alluding to. In this journey called entrepreneurship there are times we question if we are on the right path for various reasons. Sometimes it's because of #poketwatching other folks and their success. Other time it's because you're doing something no one else is doing. And new paths take some time to forge.Truth be told, I've definitely wondered about this whole #BrandEcho thing, lol. But I know building a brand takes time.&nbsp;The point, this was new wind added to my sails (boating reference) to keep pushing for on my goal of building 5 brands in this decade.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB
