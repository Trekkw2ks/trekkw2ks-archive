12-11-2020#QualitativeObservation&nbsp;:Recently @coindesk and CoinMarket Cap publisher their crypto #Influencer list. Some figures listed have shown no proof of being influencial. Let loan if they are actually friends to the community.But are these crypto platform wrong in making such a list, when in the US the "incoming" Biden Kamela administration is toughted to be great and wonderous with no days in the seat.Does actually having proof of influencial or great even matter any more? Or is it all about marketed projectetion?
