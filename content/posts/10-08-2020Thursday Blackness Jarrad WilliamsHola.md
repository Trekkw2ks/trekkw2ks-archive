10-08-2020Thursday Blackness: Jarrad WilliamsHola Hola G&amp;Gs,Today's hattiip and&nbsp;raisedfist&nbsp; goes to Jarrad Williams. He's the founder of KareTaker Network. Considering how many people work in the care taking field and all the things needed to be tracked, I can see a type of blockchain being used to bring everything together.&nbsp;Jarrad is a serial entrepreneur and advised other crypto companies like Hemp Coin and Go Network. I just wanted to say thankyou sir for stepping forward in the space and showing that black people are more than consumers. We are innovators, influencers, and creators.&nbsp;It should be noted that even though some of the founders I've covered are no longer working on the blockchain project mentioned. It doesn't deminish the fact that they did create something based on blockchain technology.Post 10-9-2020hhimtrekk ThursdayBlackness NotJustConsumers BlacksinTech&nbsp; BlacksInBlockchain&nbsp; BlacksInCrypto Trekkw2Ks #2020AintReady ThinkersnDoers PoverB
