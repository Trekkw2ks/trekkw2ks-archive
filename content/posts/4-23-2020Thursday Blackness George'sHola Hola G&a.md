4-23-2020Thursday Blackness: George'sHola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's post is prerecorded from my trip to #Joburg. I was invited by @Kofi to attend the Blockchain Africa Conference. Thanks again sir.Any who, today's&nbsp; #raisedfist goes to George. He's a a senior risk analyst at the Central bank of Cameroon and has his own company operating in #Lagos. I heard him say on a panel, "give the communities blockchain and let them use it as they need..." (paraphrased.)Have to admit, I was surprised to hear this coming from a banking guy. But I had to talk with him to learn more.Once again, thanks to @bitcoin events for the conference.&nbsp; I'm really looking forward to next year.#hhimtrekk #ThursdayBalckness #southafrica #cameroon #bankers#BAC20202 #community #africa #ThinkersnDoers #2020aintready&nbsp;#PoverB&nbsp;
