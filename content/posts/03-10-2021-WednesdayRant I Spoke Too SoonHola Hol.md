03-10-2021#WednesdayRant: I Spoke Too SoonHola Hola GnGs,Today's vlog is me admitting to myself that I spoke too soon about always #showingup on the last #WednesdayRant.So, what am I talking about?Well after doing a full week of 12 hour days, 10 of which I'm on my feet reaching a #stepcount of up 55K. I realized something. Let me translate for those not in to #smartwatches and counting. I walk more than 10 miles a day. At my current duty site, I see the sky go from dark to light and back to dark.The point is this is the perfect recipe for burning out. I explain the why and how I'll adjust to continue pushing out content.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #BurnOut
