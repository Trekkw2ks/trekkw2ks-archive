UntitledPleebs Have Money TooHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,This morning, I checked email and found a letter from the President of the CfPA (Crowdfunding Professional Association) based in DC. Now before you go thinking I'm special and connected. It's so not the case, &#128528;.Because, so did the other 100 + member of the association.&nbsp;Two side notes 1. the plus is based on the finger math of the @samson. Who's also the president. 2. Because he ran of to the barren state of Phoenix there will be no #MilkyWayHappyHour in Nov &#128546; (unless @george wants to cover down on happy hour, lol). Let's see if social pressure works &#128526;.Ok, now back to the email and #crowdfunding.As you see in the picture, Samson drops the numbers about&nbsp; @Kickerstarter being able to attract more than $59B in pledges from 2009 to 2021. Most readers will look and think we'll that makes sense, it had to be with VCs, high net worth individuals, and accredited investor types.However, I'd argue that it's a false assumption. Because back in 2009 Kickstarter was market for the no savings account having, made less than $40K a year, non-savy investor, and non-accredited folks looking to support a project they believed in and or hoped would be something big.&nbsp; My first point is a sizable segment of the $59B came from the pleebs who made the leap. Which means pleebs have money. And the second point is that most entrepreneurs looking to crowd fund keep over looking them for VCs and angle investors because they only see an end users for a product or service.Base on what I'm seeing and hearing, this decade will change that as the JOBS ACT and crowdfunding technologies matures.Speaking of technology, IMO, I think the whole crowdfunding community should thank the crypto space for showing them the way. Remember how ICOs (initial Coin Offers) provided access to everyday people globley to fund real and vaporware blockchain projects. But then the US took action to throttle the growth and get its cut, aka #GangGang. But I digressI'm no number cruncher but in my humble opinion, if crypto crowd funding would've continued via ICOs, $59B would be old news in 2021.Nonetheless, the operational environment is what it is. More people are becoming aware of opportunities like Reg A and #RegCF (no VC needed). And there are organizations like CfPA.&nbsp;If you're in the states and looking to start or scale a business, tap into the resources and network of the CfPA. Remember, pleebs have money too.
