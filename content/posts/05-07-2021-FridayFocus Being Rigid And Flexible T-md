05-07-2021#FridayFocus: Being Rigid And Flexible To ChangeHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;&#128270;&#129488;,Today's vlog is based on of course some recent situations aka experience I'm currently dealing with, lol.The story of a entrepreneur never ends, smh.I was telling one of my Joe's the other day, complacency is one of the things I worry about while on this current assignment. It can get you stuck when it comes to adopting to change.I cover more in the vlog as usual. But the takeaway is that complacency can lead to rigid thinking and actions. Sometimes, staying rigid is needed to continue on mission. But it is a balance of knowing when to be flexible to change.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB&nbsp;
