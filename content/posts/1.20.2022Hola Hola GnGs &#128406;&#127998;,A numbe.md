1.20.2022Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,A number of years ago, someone told me the longer you stay in the space the smaller is gets. However, I'll add the caveat, it's&nbsp; based on how active you are.Meaning, if you don't actually engage with others online/IRL your network doesn't grow and could actually shrink. People do forget none active people.I suppose this applies to any industry.One of the things I find interesting about the crypto space is how people mature in it. Granted not everyone grows to better their position in life. There are definitely some tragic and sad story. But for now my focus is on the gentleman you see in the picture.&nbsp;After the first day of the The North American Bitcoin Conference, iAttended the #VersaceManson dinar party. A very nice surprise was running into another friendly face and hearing how he bettered his life.I met Milton Guarderas ✔️ at an event in #Canada in 2019. He recently learned about bitcoin and figured a way to get some despite being homeless. Which was just a few months before we met.I'm continually amazed at the people I meet in the space. Milton is the proverbial rags to riches. He now lives in Europe and travels to wayyy more events than me, lol.Milton's story is inspiring. It's a good motivator for 2022.My point is everyone has the opportunity to better their life. But like most things, it boils down to how smart and or hard your willing to work.Till we met again Milton.Have a #P0verB day GnGs.#Trekk2wks #ThinkersnDoers #TNABC #VersaceManson #BitcoinChangerMylife #Networking&nbsp;#InvestInPeoplelink
