03-04-2021#ThursdayBlackness: Varun BakerHola Hola GnGs,Today's #handclaps and #raisedfist goes to Varun Baker. He is in the island of #Jamaica making it happen with the introduction of blockchain to agriculture. If don't know what's going on in the #Caribbean with local farmers trying to compete with international importers then what Varun is doing with non traditional micro loans makes no sense. But for the small farmers of the island that gave the world #reggie and #BobMarley, it makes all the sense.I want to say thank you sir for your work and contribution to the crypto space. I hope we can connect one day.Btw, a pointy headed birded (@samson)&nbsp;told me there is a canibus tour is being planned to visit the dispensaries of the island. I don't smoke but would like still like to come down and explore.#Trekkw2ks #BlockchainInJamica #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #BlacksinTechPosted 03-07-2021
