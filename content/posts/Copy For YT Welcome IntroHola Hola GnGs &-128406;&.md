Copy For YT Welcome IntroHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;, This is a video explaining why I created my own channels after so many years of making content. I'm taking everything that I can find online, lol. And bring it all here. So that's the live streams, my podcast stuff, interviews, LinkedIn vlogs (and micro articles), plus stuff from Tic-Tok and Instagram. If you didn't know I'm a contributor to two of the longest running crypto related YouTube channels. I host My Two Satoshis on link . And I have a segment called Weekend Crypto on &nbsp;@The Gentlemen of Crypto&nbsp;. So I'll be adding those on here too. I'll be going a number of years back. So you'll see the raw ugliness of how I started making content about crypto. I hope you're ready.&nbsp; I know I'm not, lol.PS: if you're interested in reaching me out side of YT, all you have to do is put my name is any search engine (or LinkedIn, Tic Tok, IG, n Twitter). I always pop up, unless the platform is shadow banning me for what every reason, lol.
