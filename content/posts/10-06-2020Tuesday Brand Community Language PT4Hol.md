10-06-2020Tuesday Brand: Community Language PT4Hola Hola G&amp;Gs,In today's #vlog, I talk about the 3 types of community, the clientele. The following links cover the series of #communitylanguage so far. Again, my focus is the purchaser of the product or service and not the none paying members.&nbsp; That will be for another time.Series links:Pt1-&nbsp;linkPt2-https://www.linkedin.com/posts/trekkwith2ks_communitylanguage-consumers-brandnarrative-activity-6714743843348078592-Bp9qPt3-https://www.linkedin.com/posts/trekkwith2ks_vlog-communitylanguage-consumers-activity-6716800179783143424-FZHcThe quick take is #clientele are attracted to a brand's voice because the brand take the time to build a rappart with them. The narrative isn't price driven in terms of offering #2for1 deals or half off pricing. Clientele are ok with paying a premium. I detail more of the difference between #consumers, #costumers, &amp;&nbsp; cleintele.#hhImtrekk #Tuesdaybrand #brandbuilding #whoyouattract #3Cstypeofcommunities #2020aintready #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #trekkw2ks
