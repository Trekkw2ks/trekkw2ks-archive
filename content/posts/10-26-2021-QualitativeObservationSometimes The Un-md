10.26.2021#QualitativeObservation:Sometimes The Unrelated Relates To YouHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,So as usual, I'm on my #AudiobooksandBuild game. Originally, I was planning to post this as a #TuesdayBrand but figured most wouldn't get it. Plus I was being lazy about making a vlog.One of the books I started is The Age Of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff. The first chapter alone had me reexamine my understanding of digital surveillance and where technology sits as a driver or passenger in the ecosystem.And of course since I'm a crypto guy I start thinking about open blockchains and how they retain information FOREVER.Don't act like you didn't see that coming &#128518;.It just so happen that the following things happened in the space after I started the book. So of course my mind is running with questions and making possible connections.1. Tether has to pay $41mil fine to CFTC for making false claim of reverse. But no one saying anything about JPM or Goldman Sachs not have real reserves.2. The SEC wins regulatory control of #stablecoins with Gary Ginsler at the helm. And they want to make it like bank deposits. Get ready for the #BlueDog to wag it's tail.3. Bakkt announced it's partner ship with #MasterCard. IMO, this another financial choke point being sold as mass adoption of crypto.4. And can't forget Facebook is rebranding and getting into the #Metaverse. Sounds alot like #IOI in Ready Player One (read the book, the ref makes way more sense.)Social media and finance seem to be two parts of SurvCap (surveillance capitalism) that most folks are aware of and arguably cool with. #WalledGardens flourish because people prioritize convieniance.I wonder what will society look like when you put programmable money in the full control of governments and the private sector?I guess time will tell.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers&nbsp;Posted 10.27.2021LinkedIn, Twitter, n IG
