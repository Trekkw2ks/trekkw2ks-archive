03-19-2021#FridayFocus: Untold FutureHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on a book I just finished called Cryptoassets: An Investors Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond by Chris Burniske&nbsp; and Jack Tatar.No. I'm not giving any #financialadvice, lol.But the book did get me thinking about how we don't know what the future holds when I comes to our business and the larger industry.Yes, as entrepreneurs we have to stay focused gold of building the business into a company that scales. But it doesnt mean stick your head in the sand and pay no attention to what going on in your industry.The space has changed so much in the last year. And that's not even including how covid influenced other industries.I make the point in the vlog. But the take away is don't forget to have some level of awareness on what else is developing in your industry.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB&nbsp;
