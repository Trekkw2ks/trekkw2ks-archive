05-17-2021#MondayPush: That's What I Got For YouHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;&#128170;&#127998;,oday's vlog is a moment of introspection. This is in part because my internet went on the frets. So I was unable to work on things needing the web. I promise the subcap will make sense in the end, lolAnd as you can see I enjoyed the moment with a #cigar. For those wondering it was a #specialops. No I don't smoke on the regular, it was a gift.The point to this vlog is even though there's always something needing to be done as a entrepreneur, sometimes you have to sit still, review (recent events and your actions), and mentally build/push yourself for the tasks and goals ahead.That was definitely me today while blowing smoke.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoer #PoverB&nbsp;posted date 5-18-2021
