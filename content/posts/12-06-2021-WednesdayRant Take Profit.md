12-06-2021#WednesdayRant: Take ProfitHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on a #Youtube reply I woke up to this morning and how much it annoyed me.TBC, I'm not looking to drop names or talk bad about anybody but today's rant is based on something I've consistently seen play out when it comes to the folks who got in after 2017.You can generally tell their level of education and line of work based on how they talk about crypto. At least in my experience.I guess this goes to @samson point about how #HumansSuck in that we gravitate towards #groupthink and action over time. So it your about getting the &#128176; then you want/expect other people to be about the same.The vlog covers more why this mindset annoys me. Nonetheless, I've been long enough to know, I can't tell people how to operate in the space. So believe what you want and #takeprofit.#Trekkw2Ks #CryptoLife #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB
