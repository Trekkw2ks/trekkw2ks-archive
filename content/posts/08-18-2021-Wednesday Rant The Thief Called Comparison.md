08-18-2021#WednesdayRant: The Thief Called ComparisonHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog was triggered by a YouTube video. The made a statement about comparison being the thief of happiness.It got me thinking about a number of things. I ramble a lil about them in the vlog.The takeaway is don't let #SoMe fool you into thinking your happiness (or value) is based on comparing you life to others.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #TheBluePrint&nbsp;
