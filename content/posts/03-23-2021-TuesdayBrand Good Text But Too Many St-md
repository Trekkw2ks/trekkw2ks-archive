03-23-2021#TuesdayBrand: Good Text But Too Many StepsHola Hola GnGs ,As some of you know I'm in a warm place temporarily. It's really not that warm down here but it's better then where I'm on the way back to, smh.Nonetheless, this post isn't about weather.&nbsp;It's about a text message my sister had with the guy who delivered her breakfast. It's is often said as an entrepreneur you have to sell yourself, meaning telling people what the hell you're doing!!! Kind like how I'll be doing in a few days about my #ebook SGT Trekk: Life After AIT, When The Real Shit Starts.&nbsp;Any who, there's a point.&nbsp;In oder to make those sales of what every the product or service is, you have to have an audience. The trick is building the audience based on who you have access to. I explain what this person did. And why most entrepreneurs will fail in this decade in the vlog.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #Puttinginthework #BrandBuilding
