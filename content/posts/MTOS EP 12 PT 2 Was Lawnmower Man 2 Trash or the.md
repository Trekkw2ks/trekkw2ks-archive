MTOS EP 12 PT 2: Was Lawnmower Man 2 Trash or the Future of Metaverses?Welcome to Metaverses: The Other SideIn this show, we talk about non-blockchain and blockchain-related metaverses. We don't get into price talk, trading, or the speculative nature of the space. But, there are other content creators on TGOC network who do. So please take the time to explore those contributors. However, from time to time, we ramble off possible business models that can be applied to metaverses. In addition, we have conversations on everything from metaverse-related movies/TV shows to open-source no-code to code-ready tools. And how they can be used to design and build metaverses while combining technologies like smart contracts, NFTs, and DAOs to them.For those who wonder why the audio doesn't match what is being seen on the screen, it's because Twitter Spaces are like podcasts, just audio. So, we decided to play various content related to metaverses. Some videos will be of us exploring or building and others will be AI generated visual content. At the end of the day, we're just two cypherpunk guys on the Spaces geeking out about VR/AR, gaming, metaverses, and what it means to the future of the internet as part of web3.If you're interested in participating in the live conversation, join us on the @BuildRDAO Twitter Spaces at 8PM EST on Thursdays.MTOS EP 12 PT 1: Was Lawnmower Man 2 Trash or the Future of Metaverses?Here's the second half of the convo we had about Brett Leonard's Lawnmower Man 2. It's true that graphics from back in the day are pretty cheesy when you compare then to movies like Inception or Avatar. But conceptual, there is no question, movies like this are a head of there time. Which is something 3D brings up often about scifi flicks from 20 plus years ago. If you look at where we are technology wise, it take about 3 decades to see things from those movies in real life.So imagine the movies and TV shows coming out now and what the real life version of the tech will be down the road.&nbsp;Please remember we hold the live Spaces on Thursday @ 8PM EST.Thanks in advance.Find us on Twitter:@Trekkw2ks@__3D___@BuildRDAOWebsites:If you're a believer in decentralized and open source technology, please checkout our sites.
