05-12-2021#WednesdayRant: The BlueDogs of InclusionHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;&#128483;️,Today vlog is based on a Max Kieaser interview. I don't remember who he was talking to but the gentlemen said something that perked my ears.He talked about how governments are working to centralize thing. And one of the things to used to coral people would be&#128178;. As Samson likes to call it #programablemoney.Programmable money is old news to me. But what caught my attention was how it would be sold to the masses. That would namely be CBDCs (or as I call them #BlueDogs) and #inclusion.I bring the other in the vlog. The takeaway, CBDCs only work when you get everyone to be in the system.#ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #Trekkw2ks
