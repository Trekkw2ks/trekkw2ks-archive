12.11.23Hola Hola GnG &#128406;&#127998;,Why do people think the SEC and #GaryGensler are playing fair when it comes "regulating" crypto? A #FOIA request was made public recently. And it clearly shows Senator #elizebethWarren's office colluding with Gensler's office on questions and talking points for their subcommittee meeting.Shout out to @ Caitlin Long for catching the post and resharing it. And shame on #Twitter for shadow banning the original video she shared. Ironically, none of the crypto news sites touched the story. I wonder why? Hopefully, this one still shows vid.PS is anyone paying attention to the crypto provisions that were dropped from the #NDAA. Who #lobbied for that and why?#Trekkw2ks # TheSubTekks #PoverB #Congress #CryptoRegulation #TreasuryDept #OFAC #KStreet
