09-15-2021#TuesdayBrand: Talk Your Shyt And Hold Your GroundHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is about shyt talking about your industry to establish yourself at an authority in that market. Total sidenote, this is the strategy politicians used to get (re)elected. I just put that together.&nbsp;I think @samson and @pomp are very effect at this type of content creation.If you follow my SoMe, I tend to do the same but not as PC about it like other folks. Probably why I don't get invited to places&#129335;&#127998;&zwj;♂️, lol.The takeaway is talking shyt is a effective strategy to build brand awareness.#Trekkw2ks&nbsp;#ThinkersnDoers&nbsp;&nbsp;#PoverB&nbsp;#TalkingShyt ##BrandEcho
