WC 12.08.24HOLA HOla GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,&nbsp;I'm #Trekkw2ks. If you're new to my segment #WeekendCrypto, thanks for taking the time to tap in. The basic idea is I cover events related to crypto that happen over the weekend, between Friday and Sunday. This isn't about price talk but giving context to events happening in the space.
