Okay&nbsp;How this is because recently we had it happened that YouTube had a situation which is still unclear for what exactly happened where other good number of the popular and is well as smaller known content creators in the crypto space had their content of deleted and flagged for various issues.&nbsp;And it caused good amount of uproar this is right before uproar before I was right before Christmas and since a lot of the content creators who are consistent with the content are starting to monetize or have been monetizing the platform they became dependent on the money by the platform and as such them getting their content deleted or getting flagged for stuff with stopping the money from coming in my point to this whole thing isI think the people in the crypto space got comfortable upper or before I is right before Christmas And since a lot of the content creators who are consistent with the content are starting to Monett eyes or have been Mana sizing the platform they became dependent on the money by the platform and as such them getting their content deleted or getting flag of stuff with stopping the money from coming in my point to this whole thing is&nbsp;I think the people in the crypto space got comfortable in that they became dependent on centralized centralized platforms to monetize their message of content related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies and as such when the experimentation or SMI are arguing the intentional direction of using the Algos to Target crypto and blockchain based content it highlighted that again this is an experiment with an experiment it's a Capstone project we're not the only ones in it and that's why I'm a go with that one stop.
