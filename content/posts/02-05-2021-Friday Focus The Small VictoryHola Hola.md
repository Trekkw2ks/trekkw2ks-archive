02-05-2021#FridayFocus: The Small VictoryHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's vlog is me sharing a small victory that I had this morning.Writing my ebook has been a hell of a learning process, especially for what I thought I knew. But the technical aspects of implementing the blockchain features of #NFTs has been a headache and a half.On top of dealing with #writersblock I've been hitting technical #roadblocks since last December. I actually wanted to drop SGT Trekk: Life After AIT, When The Real Shit Starts. So even though today was a small victory to my bigger goal.&nbsp;It was perfect timing because I was really getting frustrated.The point, sometimes you have to keep hitting the wall until it breaks. Either you adjust or go home.#trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #SmallVictory #LegacyBulePrint
