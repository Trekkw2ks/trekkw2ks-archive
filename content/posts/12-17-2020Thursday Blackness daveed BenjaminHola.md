12-17-2020Thursday Blackness: daveed BenjaminHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's #raisedfist and hattip goes to Daveed Benjamin. I met him at the #BlackBlockchainSummit @howard.I didn't realize how deep into tech was/is, at the time. He's the other half of Bridget.io with @Jamel. And he recent started a online school called Skool.You are a man of many. I just wanted to say thank you for doing your part to show that black people are more than consumers. We are #innovators, #creators, and #influencers.Watch the video to see his profile.#hhimtrekk #ThursdayBlackness #mappingwords #Think#2021IsAlmostHere&nbsp;
