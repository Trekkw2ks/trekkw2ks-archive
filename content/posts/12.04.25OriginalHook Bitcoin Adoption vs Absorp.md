12.04.25Original:Hook: Bitcoin: Adoption vs AbsorptionHOLA HOLA G&amp;GS &#128406;&#127998;,It's Thursday and I'm finally putting together my takeaway from Tuesday's Trekkw2ksLive episode. Its not Monday's because, I ran into a bed and weighted blanket, vary dangerous combo.On to the topic at hand. While crawling Twitter for posts that ScratchMyBraiin, I came across Jessica Gonzales's (image below). I believe she makes a very valid point about BTC's current state. Which "A" applies to what we are witnessing as it matures? Is this adoption or is it absorption?Problem:&nbsp;Gonzales stance is the public is being mislead about actual BTC adoption by TradFi. The data shows they are creating more financial instruments (ETFs. futures, collateralized debt instruments, notes, etc) based on BTC. Making Michael Saylor's &#128142; hand for spot BTC far from industry norm.Example: So had a chat with Grok and found this list of ETFs created.

There were a number of ETFs that had no ticker. 2025 was the blowup year fro crypto ETFs. In addition, the same thing is happening in the mining space.Insight: Crypto adjacent financial products will continue to expand, like ICOs did before the 2018 Crypto winter. And WallStDaddys see that vets of the crypto space who hold the OG BTC ideals are the minority mindset, today. IMM, most people today do not care about economic sovereignty or freedom. Why? Because they don't want to deal with the actual responsibility of enforcing it. So the industry continues to build more products and services based on crypto to provide a high level of convenience but slowly degrades individual sovereignty. So the trade-off is TradFi holds the gate-guard position while people enjoy delegated financial responsibility.&nbsp;CTA: Do you agree with Gonzales? Are we witnessing real adoption or is crypto just being pulled back into the fold of Wall St? Is my takeaway too far fetch or just a the open secrete no one admits to?

Reality check, most people today don&rsquo;t give af about economic freedom. Why? Responsibility is heavy, bro. So the industry just keeps dropping convenient shiny wrappers while quietly draining your sovereignty one financial product at a time. Trade-off: TradFi stays gatekeeper, you get dopamine hits and someone else to blame when it blows up. Easy mode activated&nbsp;Do you agree with Gonzales?
