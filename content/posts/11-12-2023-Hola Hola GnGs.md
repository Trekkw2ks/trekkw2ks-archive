11.12.23Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,&nbsp;Did you know through various fights, tricks, and agreements, there are over 190 recognized countries covering this dirt ball called earth.&nbsp;And two of them recently agreed to do something very interesting. I see this as a indicator of what's to come.Dear I say, the #RState and the #UAE are setting the president for how #CBDCs (or as I call them #BlueDogs) will be used outside of US influence. Inturn creating another financial mechanism that insulates them from western sanctions (which were ineffective any).&nbsp;And thanks to human nature and technology cycles or as Samson Williams says #HumansSuck, nearly 200 nations will go through a phase of running their own digital fiat. Everyone will get to show boat their BlueDog as being different. Much like what happened in the crypto between 2015 and 2017, everyone had their own fork (version) of Bitcoin's blockchain. Remember, the technical barrier to entry is being lowered year for year. In addition to companies like Ripple, there be a plethora grifters pushing white labeled software to governments.&nbsp;Nonetheless, let me circle back to my takeaway/point. Expect to see more deals like what the UAE and R-state are doing. At the stage of thing, it only makes sense especially since the US/West can't do anything to stop them.#trekkw2ks #PoverBDay #MultipolarWorld #sanctions
