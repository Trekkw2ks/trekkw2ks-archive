07-07-2021#WednesdayRant: Getting out The Uniform To Travel MoreHola Hola GnGs,Today's vlogs is little ramble on how I miss traveling.&nbsp; I wasn't on @samson level of globe trotting but I was definitely more mobile before wearing the uniform full time.The past few days I've seen how people are getting out more. And it got me &#129300; of how I had plans pre-COVID. DC happened and some other things and opportunity presented itself by way of the uniform.But it came with trade-offs as everything does in life.The point is I'm going back to my temporary uniform status sooner than later. And I'm working in the plan to get back out there to connect with people, find new energies and inspiration.&nbsp;After all, life is lived by getting out there and enjoying it.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #PlanesTrainsandAutomobilesI&nbsp;
