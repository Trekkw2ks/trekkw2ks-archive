02-19-2021 FridayFocus: What's Your Target?Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,&nbsp;Today's vlog is based on a interview I saw on #SocialProofPodcast with Hugh Grant. For those who don't recognize the name, he's a real estate mogul in the states.He was talking about how he got his show. I talk more about that in the vlog.&nbsp;What got my attention was how he focused his intentions by declaring an exact target.&nbsp;Meaning he knew what he was aiming for. Its been my experience that buddies entrepreneurs we can get caught up in being busy to say we are working but have no actual target to work towards.My caveat to what Grant explained is that action with no intention is wasted energy.Why?Because if you have no intention behind your actions thats just busy works, which leads to nothing being complected.One thing I realized while writing this is people who are good at execution are profiscent because they only take action based on intention(s) to reach a set goal.&nbsp;Which in turns attracts Like minded people. #LawofAttractionBTW, I ramble know some more in the vlog about this and what I'm setting for my target this decade.#Trekkw2Ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #SetYourTarget #BrandEcho #Checkin
