04-06-2021#TuesdayBrand: Free Content &amp; Paid ExecutionHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on an OG youtuber named #EliTheComputerGuy. The other day, he made a video about another youtuber (Louis Rossmann, sorry didn't remember name during recording) who asked him for advice about creating content for his new channel. Rossmann's channel was about fixing @apple devices.&nbsp;At the time no one was making that kind of content. And Rossman already had a running a small business fixing apple devices. Eli's advice went against the traditional business mind at the time.&nbsp;That logic was lost on why would you freely give away the information on how to fix the devices? It turns out Eli was right to encourage him to make free #HowTo content. BTW, if you're a #DIYer who loves tinkering, you can say thanks to Rossmann for talking to congress and fighting the industry for the #RightToRepair movement.In the vlog, I break down how this benefits entrepreneurs who provide services while worrying about how much free information to give. Just remember most folks, won't do the work themselves. And the ones who will aren't your customers anyway.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #BrandEcho #BrandDevelopment
