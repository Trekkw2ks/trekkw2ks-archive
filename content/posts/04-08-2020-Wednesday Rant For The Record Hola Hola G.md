4-08-2020Wednesday Rant: For The RecordHola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's post is to note the offical crossing over of Trekk Smart Consulting. Basically, I'm stepping back from blockchain/crypto education and focusing on storytelling for the brand development of startups and small businesses related to the blockchain/crypto space.&nbsp;IMO, the industry has picked up bad habits from siliconvalley when it comes to customeraquisition. I blame analog oldschool marketing thinking. But I degrease.The point is I'm not just talking a good game, but pivoting too.hiimtrekk wednesdayrant ThinkersnDoers PoverB officialpivot businessdevelopment&nbsp;
