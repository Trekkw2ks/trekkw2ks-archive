02.03.2022Hoal Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,I heard this story last night on YouTube. I had to share cause it had me cracking up. The cliff note is man deposits $33K to Bank of American with a #CashersCheck. Allegedly, no one told Brian Leonardo that branch was scheduled to close that same day. But they did take the check saying it would clear no later than the next day. To Brian's surprise the money was not in his account the next day and no one would help him at BoA figure out what happened.If this story ain't the perfect example of why a public ledger aka #blockchain has utility. There's something about being able to verify a transaction for yourself and not having to take the banks word for it. But you'll don't like hearing about #EconomicSovereignty and #BeingYourOwnBank. Why do that?Any who, growing up, my mom would always say "remember to keep you receipt. You never know if you have to go back to the store for a issue." It was like a golden rule for adults to be a smart customer. I'm guessing the guy Brian heard the same thing growing up. The irony of his story is having the &#129534; as proof of "transaction". But keep getting told there is "no record" of it in their system. And no one could help.&nbsp; So, what's the point of keeping a receipt? &#129335;&#127998;&zwj;♂️Btw, that is the #CustomerSupport everyone swears crypto needs to have a better UX. By everyone I mean Samson.Welcome to the digital age. I see the same thing in the military. Alot of the new supply folks don't know how to process thing manually if/when the system (software) goes down. Which is the same as if they can't see it in the system then it doesn't exist.A quick googly search shows that nearly 3,000 banks closed last year. Imagine how many other people this is happened to and not just with BoA. But it's not news worthy because it's not 5 figures. Smh &#129318;&#127998;&zwj;♂️.In 2022, people ignore the fact that up to 30% of the US's population is unbank and or underbanked. But yet we're constantly told this is a better system and crypto needs to be accepted by these types of banks to reach mass adoption. So at some point in #theTrustlessDecade, banks will promote custodial services for your crypto and charge you for things that don't need a #middleman.&nbsp; And since people have &#128031; &#129504;, it's going to be a sad day for me cause I know people will sign up for it.Other observations, the news station probably wouldn't have helped Brian if it wasn't a 5 figure amount. And the reason for issue stated by the bank smells a little fishy. Accepting the cashers check (from Wells fargo) generated a transaction reference ID in BoA's system. So, either the system has a bug or the teller did sent the funds to the wrong account. But to say the check was lost because it was made to the bank and not his account doesn't make sense. Again, what's the point of the receipt that documents it going to HIS account?Remember, tech works until it doesn't work. And contrary to popular thinking when you put currency (USD) in a bank. It's not your money any more, at least in the states. It's the banks &#128176;.#Trekkw2ks #BankingSucks #Blockchain #Crypto #DoddFrankAct #MondernBanking
