05-19-2021#WednesdayRant: Proud and InspiredHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;&#128400;&#127998;,Today's vlog is a combo of people in my circle that I'm proud to know in the space as well as being inspired by seeing there growth.So, my son isn't in the space per say but I'm proud of him. For a while I've been trying to figure out how to get my kids involved in the business side of blockchain/crypto. I finally did it by having him #proofread my soon to come #ebook Sgt Trekk: Life After AIT, When The Real Shit Starts. He nailed. He's now locked in as editor of my future &#128218;s.Then there's Tavonia Evens and what she's doing with the #GuapFoundation for Guapcoin. When trying to build a crypto community with out the financial backers like other projects is a process with a number of hurdles. This will be the decade to #betonblack.A few other names I mention in the vlog are Isiah Jackson, King Bless, Kenn Bosak. The point is my circle is composed of people that I've taken the time to build rapport with. And over the years they have inspired me in various ways to continue my entrepreneurial trek.&nbsp;#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #Family #PnI
