5-28-2020Thursday Blackness: Chris MugendiHola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Todays delayed #raisedfist and hat tip goes to @chris Mugendi. I connected with him on LinkedIn in 2018. He graduated from University that year too.&nbsp; In 2019 he worked hard to do research and write about the crypto space. 2020 was his leveled up by becoming the community manager for&nbsp; @crypto.com in Kenya.&nbsp;Crazy to see how time flies but love to see people grow.&nbsp;You have definitely done that sir.#hhimtrekk #ThursdayBalckness #kenya #africa #blacksintech #innovators #influencers #inventors #levelup #growth #connections #ThinkersnDoers #2020aintready #PoverB&nbsp;
