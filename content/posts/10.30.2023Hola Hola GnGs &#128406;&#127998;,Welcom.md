10.30.2023Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Welcome to another segment of #WeekendCrypto. In today's episode, I cover a story that reminded me of #TomCruise in #JerryMaguire. If you're of a certain age, you known the scene &#128483;&#129315; .In the wake of #TerraLuna, #Celsius, and #FTX, the CEXs scrambled to come up with a way to regain the trust of their users. Thanks to court documents and people basically spilling the &#127861;, the&nbsp; &#128008;&nbsp; is out the bag. And the public learned the industry secret that exchanges were mixing users funds with any and everything and even lost track of them.Thuse Proof of Reserves was born. If memory serves, #Binance was the first to go public with it. But did it actually allow the users to independently verify the exchange's on-chain and off-chain accounting of assets? The short answer, HELL NO!!!Nonetheless, Backed Finance AG&nbsp; feels they are leading the way with Chainlink Labs&nbsp; version of #PoR being integrated in their tokenomics. Will this be become an industry standard for the CEXs, I can see a high chance of this smoke and mirror product catching on.The takeaway, finance folks will always find a way to garner peoples' trust to hand over control of their capital. So until the next market crisis, lol with me &#128518; &#129315; &#128514; when picturing Jerry yelling "SHOW ME THE MONEY!!!Link to hear more of my rambles &#128073;&#127998; link.PS: Department of Homeland Security Using #AI to run the govrnt's disinformation&nbsp; operation is going to open a whole new can of &#129713; as we push into 2024 questioning everything. Good luck to all the true believers.#Trekkw2ks #PoverBDay #TGoC #FinancingtheMarket #BTC #DHS #NoPriceTalk #Taproot #Google #1980
