04-13-2021#TuesdayBrand: Nifty Aas NFTHola Hola GnGs &#128105;&#127998;&zwj;&#129458;,So, today's vlog is about my first #NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Technically, I minted the stuff but it's actually @Samson's art work. He came up with the piece to prove how stupid NFTs are for art. I'm just here because he contracted my services to execute. Plus, I like playing with the tech. I think even if the digital content gets sold for $5, it proves this application of the tech is valid as a #usecase. But time will tell who was right or wrong.I bring all of this up on a Tuesday Brand because it goes into the whole #BrandEcho thing. Basically, I'm getting the word out about the #HustleFundBaby is doing.&nbsp; And the service I offer people looking to get into the NFT space but don't have the time or technical know how to make it.So check out "The Art of NFT at&nbsp;link. Help me prove the #PointyHairedGuy wrong. Private sales welcomed and other cryptos besides #ethereum.&nbsp;#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #NiftyAasNFT&nbsp;
