06-22-2021#TuesdayBrand: Adding WordsHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;&#128242;,Today's vlog is inspired by a thread I happen to catch on twitter. Sorry, I don't remember the guy's name. Part of the thread explained the methods he used for audio and video content posted on #SoMe (social media).&nbsp;One of the first things he mentions is adding words to video aka #caption.&nbsp;Me reading the that post more than once&#128583;&#127998;&zwj;♂️&#129318;&#127998;&zwj;♂️ . Why?Because I was doing captions when it wasn't a feature on apps like TikTok. Oh yeah, I testing this out on there for my ebook SGT Trekk: Life After AIT, When The Real Shit Starts. It's available on #kindle at link.I explain more of my frustrations in the vlog. But the point is I "hated" (more like strongly disliked) having to add captions back then because it took so long. Come to think of it, I need #InShotApp to get this feature . I refuse to go back to those archaic days&#128581;&#127998;&zwj;♂️&#128078;&#127998;.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #SgtTrekk #LifeAfterAIT&nbsp;
