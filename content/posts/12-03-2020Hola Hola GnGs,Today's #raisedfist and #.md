12-03-2020Hola Hola GnGs,Today's #raisedfist and #hattip goes to a young man I met at my first #BlackBlockchainSummit @Howard. His name is Christian Kakoba and he wears many hats.Christian was one of the organizers behind the the summit. He's currently the COO of BitHub Africa.I want to thank you sir for doing what you do to show that black people are more than consumers.&nbsp;We are innovators, influencers, and creators.&nbsp;#hhimtrekk&nbsp;#ThursdayBlackness #BlacksinBlockchain #PoverB #BlacksinBusiness #ThinkersnDoers #2021
