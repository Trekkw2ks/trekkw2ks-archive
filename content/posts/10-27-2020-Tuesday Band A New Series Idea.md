10-27-2020Tuesday Band: A New Series IdeaHola Hola G&amp;Gs,So I had new series idea about two days ago. Don't know what I'll call it but something will come to me by the time I post, lol.&nbsp;The basic idea is to look at startups and small businesses related to blockchain/crypto and figure out what there BrandEcho is according to Trekkw2ks (me).&nbsp;As usual I break down more in the video.&nbsp;Also for the record, I'll be using @cryptojoblist&nbsp; and Agnlelist. Nether of these are paid indorsement. The same goes for the companies I choose to critquie. So everyone is fair game.&nbsp;HhImTrekk TuesdayBrand coummuntiybuilding brandbuilding casestudy #3C #2020AintReady ThinkersnDoers PoverB storytelling open dialouge&nbsp;
