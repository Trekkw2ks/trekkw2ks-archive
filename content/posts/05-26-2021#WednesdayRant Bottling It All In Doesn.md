05-26-2021#WednesdayRant: Bottling It All In Doesn't HelpHola Hola GnG &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on something going on with one of my soldiers.I've talked about having a #supportnetwork as an entrepreneur. In general, we all need some level of support. Finding the support helps to not bottle everything in.I think with everything going these days, check-ins&nbsp; are important.I get more into it in the vlog but the takeaway is find your support because bottling it all up doesn't help.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB&nbsp; #HowYouDoing
