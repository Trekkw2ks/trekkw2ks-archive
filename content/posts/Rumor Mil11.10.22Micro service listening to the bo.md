Rumor Mil11.10.22Micro service listening to the book microservices. Compare.Talked about in intra office network for rumor Mill.Thinking about how to do the same thing with a stacks smart contract so it would be rumor mill for the crypto space meets cards against humanity.The idea is over a seven day. Anyone can submit a rumor with a limited characters for storyline similar to Twitter and then they're up voted in order to vote must have x amount of crypto because tax or toshi's or BTC will be payment method to vote can 24 know 48 hours before the close of 7 days change your rumor. But have to pay to change the rumor.All right so this that would be basically adapt something to do download on your phone the rumors as far as the library or like you can only say stuff that's related to crypto so arguably it'd be like you can say cows have sex with donkeys and then be like but they win crypto and it would still count as a post but once you get voted that's where you're going to lose out at where you would get the downvote so that's like kind of the thought process behind it where.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you can submit whatever type of room you want limited uses of characters and based on what you damn another one put out there our folks buying what you're saying that's the basic bottom line of it our folks buying what you're saying or who's willing to you know what who's willing to believe or who's willing to support I don't know if that's the right word.So the question is do you set something that scrapes Reddit or do you set a scraper that goes through trending topics for Twitter cuz the idea following the concept of cards against humanity is that you have a limited selection of things too use in in your narrative but you also have to have it be about crypto so like how would that work like that that would be like the Java side or the library side of it to be able to pull from the source and say here's the top trending things what are you making in combination or like you can get to use two lines but then you have to add in your own thing I don't know where does the contract the smart contract sit in on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;The smart contract would be where you put up the funds or sorry and or where you collect the funds from because the idea is that the post that wins by the end of the 7 days they would then be able to so you have to submit an address Debbie the other part of it.So you have to submit a wallet in order to be able to receive so to cool this would work for what you call it the joint that kadeem said to me about having it where you so like using the flag wallet concept of where one wallet is flagged one wallet address is flagged. And then what you do is you use a new wallet in order to be able to purchase the nft that is minted off of the flag wallet so the idea here. Is that let me move over&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is the idea is that the winner so the smart contract would have to be able to count the votes see who wins send a message to the winner and like going here's the nft for the value of the amount of for the amount of upvotes you got I don't know how to do it where the idea is that okay so somebody is a sheriff. Am I making it too complicated probably. So my issue is one I wanted to be anonymous.&nbsp;&nbsp;2 I want it to work where we're not it wouldn't collect any information it wouldn't collect a email a phone number but then the issue is the user how did they get the push notification that would be where the issue lies in of them being able to get the notification of hey you want so cards against humanity stake in the game. Then the question&nbsp;&nbsp;The question then is how do you get people to be interested in paying to be like to give a upvote because that's the part of it where does the metric where is the park the incentive to gather the the pot of funding so the best comment wins blah blah blah amount of crypto and then that question gets into what crypto do you want? I don't know new paragraph so new paragraph.
