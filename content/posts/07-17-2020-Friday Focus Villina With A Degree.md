7-17-2020Friday Focus: Villina With A DegreeHola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's vlog is based on a recent convo I had. I say this to the ThinkersnDoers on their entrepreneurial journey, don't use a degree as your leverage.Out side of going corporate or federal career track, degrees tend to be nice wall decorations. Why, because they don't guarantee that you can do the 3 things that matter to blockchain/crypto related companies and the business world in general.To be clear I'm not poking at or making fun of folks who have degrees. You worked hard for it and that debt is all you.
