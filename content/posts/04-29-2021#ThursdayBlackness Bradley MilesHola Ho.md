04-29-2021#ThursdayBlackness: Bradley MilesHola Hola GnGs ,Today's &#127801;✊&#127998;&#128079;&#127998; going to a fellow New Yorker, Bradley Miles. He is the co-founder and CEO of Roll, a social media cryptocurrency service provider for content creators.As you hear me explain, I saw his interview with @pomp a while ago but didn't remember the name. You'll know I'm horrible with names, and there are so many projects and companies to try to keep track of in the space (#Can'tCatchThemAll).Nonetheless, it's great to see him on the #BlackInBlockchainList(thanks again to Diedre for starting this).I make these vlogs to help get the word out about black folks who have worked on projects and are actively doing their part to move the needle for the mass adoption of blockchain technology and its various use cases. And to validate, we are not just consumers. We are influencers, innovators, and creators. And more importantly, acknowledge people while they are here in the world.Thank you, sir, for what you are doing in the space. I hope to meet with you one day. I will definitely look into @Roll. I have an idea or two in applying it to my #BrandEcho.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #BlacksInBlockchain #BlacksInTech
