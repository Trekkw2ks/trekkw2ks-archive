04-21-2021#WednesdayRant: Perfect is the steady progress of trial and errorHola Hola GnGs&nbsp; ,Today's vlog is about perfection. Monday night I was going over my #ToDoList. I crossed off a number of things that day. So, I was feeling at least semi-productive. While setting up my #memecampaigns for @Guapcoin and @cryptojobslist. My mind ran back to my big to on the list. Namely my eBook #NFTs .&nbsp;Yes, I'm still working on getting some details worked out. I've heard a number of people I personally know (and strangers) say writing a book is a process. I can attest to that 1000%.So, where am I going with this. Well, when it comes to the words, the ebook SGT Trekk: Life After AIT. When The Real Shit Starts is pretty much done. What's the hold up you ask?&nbsp;It's the technical side of the NFTs. And yes, I can just set it up on @kindle and call it a day. But I'm a crypto geek at heart. This book isn't even about money. But I want it to be just right aka perfect when I launch it. I give more detail in the vlog as usual. But the bottom line, there is no exact way to write, publish, and sell a book. But in order to get closer to perfect method that works. You have to go throught the process of trial and error.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #failtolearn #failtobuild
