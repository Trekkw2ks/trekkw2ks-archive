04-28-2021#WednesdayRant: Thankful For My NetworkHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;&#128591;&#127998;&#128104;&#127998;&zwj;&#127908;,Today's vlog is an update and validation of a saying I heard when first starting my entrepeurneual trek but didn't fully value.The short of it is I'm relaunching my site because I got hacked a while back. That's the stuff I explain in the vlog.So, what does that have to do with my network? Well, I imagine at some point you've heard the saying, "your network is your net worth." If not, I explain it in the video and how this experience validated that saying.When I realized what was going on, I reached out to my circle, and they helped me. Thank you to all the folks who helped. Anytime you need something, just say the word.And yes, @samson, by the end of the week, the site will be up and have information for my #NFT services. I will also have the #ebooks listed for pre-order. I'm still working out some things on the backend.Almost there. Thanks for being patient with me.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #SayLess #IGotYouDate Posted: 04-29-2021
