11.23.25 Original:Hola Hola G&amp;Gs &#128406;&#127998;,Its the day after &#129411; day and hopefully you had a good day even if you don't celebrate.&nbsp;Now on to another Scratch My &#129504; takeaway based on Monday's #Trekkw2ksLive episode.One of the things I'm growing to appreciate about getting older is noticing the pattern of life like when things repeat. So for example you'll notice it in movies and TV shows plots, restaurant food items, electronics, etc. And with that you asses did it improve or is it a hot bag of trash.This is were being a #CryptoUnc comes in. While doing some last minute research before going live, I noticed something while going back and forth #GroK about two X posts.&nbsp;However, before I get into that, let me run down memory lane a lil by introducing you to the godfather of woo-woo #ClifHigh.&nbsp; Back in 2005, Clif produced what he called #ALTA (Asymmetric Language Trend Analysis) Reports. I can't explain how it works in computer science terms but in short, reports were publised based on data gathered by web-crawlers (software that collects info online). Clif's web-bots scoured everything from public bulletin boards to social media posts to provide an analysis of what people were talking about but more specifically a sentiment analysis&nbsp; of the words used to address the topic(s). But where's the woo you ask? Clif proposes based on words used, his algorithm could produce a level of forecasting potential future events.&nbsp;Now on to the attached clip. Its a abbreviation on 2 X posts I covered during the live. The first, #Bitzenship is a new startup operating in Italy as a #Bitcoin residency program. The second, a clip about Bitmine achieving 5% of #ETH supply.The takeaway isn't about the posts themselves but what Grok was trying to tell me about them as it relates to the ideals Bitcoin and technical working of cryptonomics. And yes there is a Clif High connection, which I'll address in a few.&nbsp;As I've mentioned before, IMM, Grok is the growing LLM expert in crypto because of its integration into X (Twitter). With that said, Grok is a repeat of Clif's web-crawler, but a nieve baby version in comparison. Why? Grok, currently doesn't provide a word sentiment analysis of data fed to it via postings. And there is a basis to how it explain certain topics. The clips highlight the subversive way it responses and explains topics related to crypto. And due to my longevity in the space, I knew what points to cap on and made Grok admit it's mistakes.All that to say, I see Grok gaining additional analysis functions. However, I don't see it losing the basis explanations. Which is dangerous for people seeking answers who dont know what questions to ask in order to get a unbiased response.PS: For as innovative as blockchain is for the monetary/financial system, most people are still stuck in their #TradFi ways.#Trekkw2ks #ScratchMyBrain #TrustedAI #AI #1984 #AICryptoAgent #AIAgentClaude vs:Here's something nobody's talking about: Your AI assistant might be gaslighting you about crypto.And if you don't know what questions to ask, you'll never catch it.Hola Hola G&amp;Gs &#128406;&#127998;,It's the day after &#129411; day, and hopefully you had a good day even if you don't celebrate.Now on to another #ScratchMy&#129504; takeaway based on Monday's #Trekkw2ksLive episode.One of the things I'm growing to appreciate about getting older is noticing the patterns of life&mdash;like when things repeat. You'll notice it in movie and TV show plots, restaurant food items, technology, etc. And with that, you assess: Did it improve, or is it a hot bag of trash?This is where being a #CryptoUnc comes in. While doing some last-minute research before going live, I noticed something while going back and forth with #Grok about two X (Twitter) posts&mdash;which you'll see in the clip below.However, before I get into that, let me introduce #ClifHigh, the godfather of woo-woo. Back in 2005, Clif started producing what he called #ALTA (Asymmetric Language Trend Analysis) Reports. In short, these reports were published based on data gathered by web-crawlers&mdash;software that collected info online from public bulletin boards to social media posts. The analysis focused on what people were talking about, but more specifically, an Emotional Predictive Weight Analysis (EPWA) of the words used to address topics. The woo part? Clif proposed that, based on EPWA, his algorithm could forecast potential future events.Now here's why this matters for anyone navigating AI and crypto today:The attached edited clip shows 2 X posts I covered during the live&mdash;one about #Bitzenship (a Bitcoin residency program in Italy) and another about Bitmine achieving 5% of ETH supply. The takeaway isn't about the posts themselves but what Grok was trying to tell me about them as it relates to the ideals of Bitcoin and the technical workings of cryptonomics.As I've mentioned before, IMM, Grok is becoming the LLM expert in crypto because of its integration into X. With that said, Grok is essentially a repeat of Clif's web-crawler&mdash;but a naive baby version in comparison. Why? Grok currently doesn't provide word sentiment analysis of data fed to it via postings; it just effectively summarizes posts. And there's a bias to how it explains certain topics.The clips highlight the subversive way it responds and explains topics related to crypto. Due to my longevity in the space, I knew what points to call cap on and made Grok admit its mistakes.All that to say: I see Grok gaining additional analysis functions in the future. However, I don't see it losing the biased explanations&mdash;which is dangerous for people seeking answers who don't know what questions to ask in order to get an unbiased response. If you're in fintech, crypto, or AI development, you need to understand these tools aren't neutral&mdash;they reflect the biases of their training data and design choices.PS: Has anyone else caught their #AI lying to them? And how did you fix it?#Trekkw2ks #ScratchMyBrain #TrustedAI #HPC #1984 #AICryptoAgent #AIAgent
