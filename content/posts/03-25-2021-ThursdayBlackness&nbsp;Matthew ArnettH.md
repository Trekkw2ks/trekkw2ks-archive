03-25-2021#ThursdayBlackness:&nbsp;Matthew ArnettHola Hola GnGs,Today's hand claps and raised fist go to Matthew Arnett. He's the CEO of @po8. The company is working to bring together under water archaeology and blockchain technology. Personally, I think this would be a interesting use case of the technology. Not to mention the amount of jobs it would bring to the bahamas.Arnett proves that black people are more than consumers. I just want to say thank you sir for your contributions to the space. And I hope this does develop into the standard for cataloging underwater sites.#Trekkw2ks #PoverB #ThinkersDoers&nbsp;Posted 03-28-2021&nbsp;
