If you've read and of my &#129504; farts or we've ever communicated with me via text, you've noticed I use shorthand for words a fair amount. I'm not talking conjugations but cutting words down to 3 or 4 letters.&nbsp; Most of the time it's a matter of being lazy. While other times its because it something crypto related.Thanks to the growth of &#128242;, texting, DM, Discord, Telegram, and the likes. Communication social norms have shifted and we now have things like text etiquette. Which makes my shorthand an accepted form. Granted, I know a few grammar police hate it but who cares.&nbsp;In the crypto space, it's like second nature when talking about tokens and the projects they're connected to. And this is one of the things I love about the space. We take from the traditional lexicon and industries and make it into our own. Case in point, tickers from the stock market.&nbsp;The words above are just a few examples. And depending on who I'm interacting with can have two totally different meanings. And it's even worst when I throw a few emojis in there &#129327;&#129335;&#127998;&zwj;♂️&#129318;&#127998;&zwj;♂️, lolCome to think of it, if you want to work in the space but have no idea what any of the tickers meant till reading this. You have some catching up to do.&nbsp; From compliance to being a social media manager ShorthandMatters. For the newbies to the space, my DM is open. And just a heads up, it's like the military. I'll start off sounding like foreign English, but over time it will all make sense. &nbsp;@ranson @crypto @stephen @bett&nbsp; @christena
