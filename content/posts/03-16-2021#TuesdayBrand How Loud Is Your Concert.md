03-16-2021#TuesdayBrand: How Loud Is Your Concert?Hola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on a conversation I had with @Bettianne the other day. I was explaining why I had to redo my #casestudies and how it was holding up my ebook #BrandEcho: Every Brand Has A Voice, Who's Echoing Yours?&nbsp;Yes, there is a hold up because of new realizations. But that's not the point of this post. The point is Bettianne said something that got me thinking about the original direction of the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;When starting the book my focus was on the three types of communities that product or service a brand could develop.They were consumers, customers, and clients or what I the 3Cs. I mentioned it a number of times last year.The takeaway is a $5 or $60 mil marketing budget to blanket advertising mediums (touch points) AKA make a loud concert doesn't gaurrantee your building a last brand echo basedlllcommunity.&nbsp;#Trekkw2ks #Bitcoin50K #ThinkersnDoers&nbsp; #PoverB #CommunutyBuilding&nbsp;
