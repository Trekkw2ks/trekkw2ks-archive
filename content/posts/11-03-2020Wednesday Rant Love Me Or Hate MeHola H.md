11-03-2020Wednesday Rant: Love Me Or Hate MeHola Hola G&amp;Gs,Today's #vlog&nbsp; is based on a Netflix series Abstract: The Art of Design, season 1 episode 2. It feature Tinker Hatfield, the creative mind behind Nike's Jordan sneaker.Yes, I'm 3 years late to this series but glad I decided to add it to my favorite list the other day.&nbsp;&nbsp;I started watching it because I was looking for some imperassion. I have a few creative ideas knocking around my head, some related to my endevors and for others I consult.&nbsp;The end of this episode Tinkers mentions how if what you're creating doesn't have people loving or hating you, then what are you doing.It got me to wonder what is my creation, that brings people or clients to emotions? is it with my words. they are my creations set out into the world.#hhimtrekk #WednesdayRant #Emotions #wordshavepower #2020AintReady #ThinkersnDoers #Trekkw2Ks #PoverB&nbsp;
