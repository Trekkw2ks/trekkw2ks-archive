MTOS EP 10: The New Work Place for Web3Welcome to Metaverses: The Other SideIn this show, we talk about non-blockchain and blockchain-related metaverses. We don't get into price talk, trading, or the speculative nature of the space. But, there are other content creators on TGOC network who do. So please take the time to explore those contributors. However, from time to time, we ramble off possible business models that can be applied to metaverses. In addition, we have conversations on everything from metaverse-related movies/TV shows to open-source no-code to code-ready tools. And how they can be used to design and build metaverses while combining technologies like smart contracts, NFTs, and DAOs to them.For those who wonder why the audio doesn't match what is being seen on the screen, it's because Twitter Spaces are like podcasts, just audio. So, we decided to play various content related to metaverses. Some videos will be of us exploring or building and others will be AI generated visual content. At the end of the day, we're just two cypherpunk guys on the Spaces geeking out about VR/AR, gaming, metaverses, and what it means to the future of the internet as part of web3.If you're interested in participating in the live conversation, join us on the @BuildRDAO Twitter Spaces at 8PM EST on Thursdays.#MTOS Ep 10: The New Work Place For Web3Ok folks since, we went far left in episode 9. So, we decided to try again to talk about the new work place and where metaverses will probably fit into the mix. I promise, we largely stayed on topic for this episode. However, we have to apologize for the audio quality. Twitter was rugging us and Trekk was one the road.&nbsp;As we say, we're not CPAs, lawyers, or financial advisors. We're just two folks geeking out with whoever joins us on the lives, lol. We certainly can't predict the future, but we definitely see the traditional work environment going through a number of changes during this decade. Hopefully, we said something that helps you to traverse the coming changes.&nbsp;Please remember we hold the live Spaces on Thursday @ 8PM EST.Thanks in advance.Find us on Twitter:@Trekkw2ks@__3D___@BuildRDAOWebsites:If you're a believer in decentralized and open source technology, please check out our sites.
