05-25-2021#TueadayBrand: The Kindle Book 1stHola Hola GnGs &#128483;️&#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is the announcement for my #ebook SGT Trekk: Life After AIT, When The Real Shit Starts, available May 31, 2021. Actually, the Kindle version will be the first digital release.&nbsp;In June, I'll release the limited #NFT cover art addition. I explain the difference in the vlog.Nonetheless, I'm one step closer to getting this first ebook #published. Funny thing, the idea of this book started from Samson. I hope that him encouraging me along means he's getting both versions, lol.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #CollectableCoverArt&nbsp;
