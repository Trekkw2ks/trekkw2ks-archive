09-09-2021#ThursdayBlackness: The Black Blockchain SummitHola Hola GnGs ✊&#127998;,Today's post is very very overdue. I haven't done one of these in a while. Still trying to figure somethings out. But nonetheless, I'm dropping this one to promote the 3rd Annual #BlackBlockchainSummit held at @howard this month.I'm going over the website to highlight some of the folks who will be there. Just a reminder, it will be online and in person.The takeaway is, organizers for conferences, summits, and other blockchain/crypto related events can't say they don't know where to look for black people in the space.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB&nbsp;
