7-29-2020Wednesday Rant: I Got A StoryHola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's vlog is based on an experience i had on @instrgam yesterday.So a scammer tried getting me for a simswope by impersonating naj. I break down the scam in the vid. Heads up, it's longer than 5 mins&nbsp;There are a few take aways for me:&nbsp;1. Scammers are creative (I actually said that to this one.)2. Scams combine things you know about in real world and things you can't verify.3. Titles of authority ie a lawyer, are part of the scam narrative.&nbsp;4. IMO, this is a indicator that black thought leaders &amp; content creators are gaining traction in the larger blockchain/crypto community. Explained inthe vid.5. Sim swoping scams still work.6. People will ignore the signs and still get caught up.The point of it all, be careful folks. As we see on youtube and twitter the scams n hacks are increasing just in times for the holiday.Oh and if you see a scammer let the community know.
