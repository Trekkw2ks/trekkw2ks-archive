04-27-2021MondayPush: Finding Your PlaceHola Hola GnG &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog was a work in progress, well at least for what I came up with while recording it. So, I was on a lil family getaway with the siblings celebrating life and adulthood. It's crazy to see how we share family traits, lol.It got me thinking about how our environment influences how we process and deal with things. And since my vlogs focus on entrepreneurship, I figured it was worth sharing about finding your place.What I realized while making the vlog is that "the place" isn't necessarily a physical location. Not to mention, how many of us can actually afford to just tap out and walk away. I know I can't. Well, not yet, lol. Nonetheless, finding your own mental resilience for a balanced state of mind can be as effective when dealing with the ups and downs of running a business. But honestly, a nice scene doesn't hurt either,We'll get there. I believe in you ThinkersnDoers.Trekkw2ks PoverB familyPosted on 04-28-2021
