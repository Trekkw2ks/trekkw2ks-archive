11.29.23 (11.30.23)Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998; ,So #blackFriday was a snooze and #cyberMonday was just a regular money back at work.But for the folks over at #OFAC, this week was special. The TLDR is they one a round of #wackamole by shutting down a crypto mixer site.Here's the article for details:&nbsp;https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1933Here's my takeaway question &#128071;&#127999;.If BTC is offically a teenager (15 yrs old) and fiat still beats crypto (privacy and TX volume) for "illegal activities", plus the crypto mixers tech still works, then what is the point of #OFAC?And will it always be seen as the good guy?#Trekkw2ks #PoverB #theSubTekks #NicolasCage #PedroPascal #Compliance #TreasuryDept #Privacy link&nbsp;#Russia #Lazarus #SanctionsPS Don't for get to pay your taxes.Dndnxm
