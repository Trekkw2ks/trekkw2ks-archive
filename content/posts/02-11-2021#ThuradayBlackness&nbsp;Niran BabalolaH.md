02-11-2021#ThuradayBlackness:&nbsp;Niran BabalolaHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Sorry to be a day late but nonetheless today's #handclaps and #raisedrist go to #NiranBabaloa. He is the founder @panvala. It is a donation driven platform that allows it's token holders to fund #ethereum based projects.Considering the price of ETH at the time of posting, I imagine some founders are happy to get a second wind to "keep the lights on" and paying their devs to work their magic.I'd like to say Babalola, thank you for what you are doing in the blockchain crypto space. I hope we can met in real life one day. I'd love to hear what you learned since you days at @Consensys.#Trekkw2ks #BlacksinBlockchain #BlafksinTech #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB
