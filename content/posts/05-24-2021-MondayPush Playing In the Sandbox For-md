So, as I've said before the words of the are finally done but adding the NFT utility of the collectable cover art has been the big issue.Luckily, a smart guy I know named Kenn bosak told me about making a #sandbox wallet to play in for link. This way I could make my mistakes and learn with out it messing up my Branded wallet.An then another smart guy I know, #3DDouglas showed me how me how to apply the idea in my head to the #smartcontract.I know most of you aren't a nerd like me about crypto. But that doesn't mean you can't find you Sandbox for you business. I explain in the vlog why having one is a pretty good idea.The takeaway, find your Sandbox.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkeranDoers #PoverB #KindleEbook #NFT&nbsp;Posted 05-25-2021
