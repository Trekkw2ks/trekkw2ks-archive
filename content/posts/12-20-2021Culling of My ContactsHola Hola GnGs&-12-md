12.20.2021Culling of My ContactsHola Hola GnGs&#128406;&#127998;,I have a cousin who literally changes his number every few months. I remember thinking how annoying it must be for him "loss contact" with people.We recently talked. Yes, I'm one of the people who get the new &#128290;, lol. He explained his logic. Which was very simple, if there has been no contact for a while (1 year for him), then he deletes the contact. This includes family.If you've followed any of my SoMe, then you know I'm a big believer in #CheckingIn with people. Sometimes it's a DM/text, a phone call/zoom, or in person chat (my fav). I've been on it before #C19 made the world remember shared moments are import, people at core like to be acknowledge, just need someone to listen, and trust is built on interactions.&nbsp;The point, the #delete and #unfollow button will be used during the last days of December 2021. It's not just a Linkedin thing. I'm doing it across everything. And yes, I know most folks won't even notice it happened.PS. I wish the best for all who don't make my list in the coming new year.https://www.linkedin.com/posts/trekkw2ks_checkingin-c19-delete-activity-6878762636763377664-YL86&nbsp;#Trekkw2ks #RandomThoughts #P0verB #NewYear2022 #MovoingOn #PSA #theTrustlessDecade
