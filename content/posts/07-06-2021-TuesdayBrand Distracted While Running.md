07-06-2021#TuesdayBrand: Distracted While RunningHola Hola GnGs,Today's vlog now that I think about it is really more of a gripe. The &#127931;plays for my first world problems &#128590;&#127998;&zwj;♂️.So, what am I going about, you ask?&nbsp;Honestly, I feel distracted from pushing my ebook, running the meme campaigns, and just building my #BrandEcho in general (at the moment) because of my current obligations to the uniform.And yes, I know it's something I chose to do.But, that doesn't change how I see the situation now and what I'm learning from it. The triathlon continues.&nbsp;I can hear two voices in my head with a slight chuckle saying "welcome to entrepreneurship".&nbsp;&nbsp;The takeaway is even with feeling down in the moment, I know I'll get back on track and pushing forward. These are the moments you have to learn to over come.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #TheProcess #BrandEcho
