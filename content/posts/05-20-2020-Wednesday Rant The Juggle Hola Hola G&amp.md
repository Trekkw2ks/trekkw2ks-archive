5-20-2020Wednesday Rant: The JuggleHola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's vlog popped into my head literally right before making it, lol. As I've mentioned a number of times. I makes these based on real world situations, mainly mine.The juggle in my case is wearing the uniform (being in the US military) and establish my branding consultancy, Trekk Smart Consulting.&nbsp;So promoting the fact that im speaking at the @cryptochick hackconf this weekend has been some work, in addition to pushing out my own content. And to take it to the next level of being online all the speaking engagements will be host on @decentraland. I'm excited.Who would have thought, I'd one day be on the same bill as Vitalik Buterin, definitely not me, lol.hhimtrekk wednesdayrant VR virtualreality hackathon realtalk planetwide howcanihelp ThinkersnDoers PoverB #2020aintready checkin
