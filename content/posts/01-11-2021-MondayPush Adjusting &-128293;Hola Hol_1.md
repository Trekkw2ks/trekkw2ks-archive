01-11-2021 #MondayPush: Adjusting &#128293;Hola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's vlog is like most of most of them inspired by what I call the #triathlon of entrepreneurship AKA my life, lol.I expand more in the vlog but the short of it all is because of my "signing to obligations &amp; commitments" (link from Friday Focus vlog). I have to make adjustments to reach my goals for this month. Publishing my ebooks #BrandEcho:Every Brand Has a Voice, Who Echos Yours and SGT Trekk: Life After AIT.&nbsp;The point, if you really want something you'll figure out how to get through or around what life situations to reach the goal.#Trekkw2Ks #TheBestLaidPlans #PoverB #ThinkersnDoers #Perspective
