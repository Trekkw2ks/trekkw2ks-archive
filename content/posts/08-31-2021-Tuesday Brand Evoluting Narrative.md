08-31-2021#TuesdayBrand: Evoluting NarrativeHola Hola GnGs&#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on a interview I watched with Jimmy Song. It was on the Gentlemen of Crypto YouTube channel.He mentioned some things about #altcoins (aka shitcoins) that got me thinking about narratives and the role they play in your brand message. TBC, I'm not endorsing any of the crypto mentioned in the vlog. I'm just using them as the example of how and why narratives change.The takeaway is the brand message doesn't have to match with how things technically work.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #BrandEcho
