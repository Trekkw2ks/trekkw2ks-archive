9.24.2025Hola Hola G&amp;Gs &#128406;&#127998;,Just now I had a sad but true reality check when it comes to this thing called the #CryptoSpace. If you're a old head in the&nbsp; aka OG-like you knew BTC from the knee high #MTGox days, you get the "Unc" or "Auntie" status for respect. But in reality your the gran-gran or pop-pop at the BBQ sitting off to the side and watching all the young bucks running their mouths off like they know everything.That said, come Sept 26th and 27th, 2025, I'll be at the 8th Black Blockchain Summit in DC at Howard University. I'll be with a number of Uncs&nbsp;and Aunties in the space, trying to pass on some wisdom to the newer generation of dreamers and innovators. If you're in the area, stop by say Hole Hola! Hell, take a selfie. You may even have the opportunity to meet the so called "Crypto Mom" Hester Peirce of the SEC.This wasn't the usual #TrekkTalk, but thanks for taking the time to read my little advert for the summit.
