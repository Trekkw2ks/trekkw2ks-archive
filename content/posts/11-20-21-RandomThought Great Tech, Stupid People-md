11.20.21#RandomThought: Great Tech, Stupid People?Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,I was listening to the #AllIn podcast this morning. The hosts gave a little insight to the recent #ConsitutionDAO that formed to buy a copy of the #USConstitution. I agree with some of what they said but not everything.Before I rattle on, let me say this is open to anyone but directed at the folks in the crypto and crowdfunding space to share their thoughts.So, in less than 5 days, a bunch of crypto people (over 12k) got together to raise $47 million on the Ethereum blockchain to buy a real world asset from the traditional auction house linkHmmm... Minus the SEC and FinCEN blessing, I wonder what that sounds like Samson Williams &#128580;.Surprise, surprise they didn't win the bid &#128583;&#127998;♂️.Why you ask?Well, because hedge fund manager and Citadel big wig&nbsp;Kenneth Griffin out bid the collective. Public secrete about auctions, when you tell people how much you have to spend before hand. You will always lose to the bidder with a bigger wallet.Guess what Griffin knew about the DAO but they didn't know about him? Analogy time, the DAO came with a pre-funded community bank card (aka the public blockchain) while Griffin came in with a #KanyeWest unlimited Black American Express.&nbsp;And in another plot twist, the DAO wasn't providing fractional ownership (tokenization) of the constitution. And no one is getting there money back, shocker. Instead, the funds currently stored with Gnosis-Safe will be put toward the $WTP token. Double shocker, there's a token &#129318;&#127998;♂️ smh.After skimming the website and their twitter feed, I believe I drank enough koolade and didn't bother with the #Discord. IMO, they virtual signaled (american patriotism) to crowdfund their project.  Reading their older posts compared to the new ones, you can see narrative switch. What the project is or true goal, I have no clue.TBC, not mad they raised &#128178;. I just think there is more to the story.Lastly, I'm all for decentralization and DAOs. The "project" proved again like ICOs did, that the tech works. Which is always my bottom line question when it comes to blockchain related use cases.PS: Guess what we're going to see more of in this decade?link to podcast&nbsp;https://youtu.be/aHScxoGggt4?t=121Link for LI&nbsp;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/trekkw2ks_randomthought-allin-consitutiondao-activity-6867884304718983170-SM5a
