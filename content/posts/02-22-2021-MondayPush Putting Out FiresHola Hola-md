Over the weekend, I finished the last to sections in my book SGT Trekk: Life After AIT, When The Real Shit Starts. And now the proofreader has it.&nbsp;Sounds simple enough, right? So where's the fire?Well the fire is finding out that my website got hacked. And I only found out after looking to get some work done to feature the ebooks.I've said it for a while now, being an entrepreneur is a triathlon. You have to deal with different this to reach the goal.The hack is 100% a fire, but it doesn't stop me from the end goal of getting the ebook out.I explain they why in the vlog.#Trekkw2Ks #ThinkersnDoers #NoStress #businesslesson #PoverB
