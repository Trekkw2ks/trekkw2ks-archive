06-03-2021#ThursdayBlackness: Finite GamesHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's&#127801;&#128079;&#127998;&#128074;&#127998; is a lil different. I'm highlighting #FiniteGames. As you see in the vlog, I show the website and the brainchild behind, jomari.As I keep saying we're more than consumers. And Jormari is a great example of that. He's using Finite Games to cross the worlds of blockchain and esports. So think NFTs and ownership of game items and history of play.I keep saying it, this is going to be the decade for black people across the globe to do create some innovative and influence things.Thanks to you and the team for your your doing Jomari.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB&nbsp; ate posted 06-07-2021
