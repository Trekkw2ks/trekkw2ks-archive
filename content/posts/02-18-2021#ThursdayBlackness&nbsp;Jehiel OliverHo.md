02-18-2021#ThursdayBlackness:&nbsp;Jehiel OliverHola Hola GnGs&#128406;&#127998;,Today's raised ✊&#127998; and &#128079;&#127998; goes to&nbsp;Jehiel Oliver. He is the founder of @hello tractor. The company works to connect farmers in #kenya, #Nigeria, and other parts of Africa with the equipment needed to cultivate the land.&nbsp;I have to say, I like how the company profile doesn't get you lost in tech buzzwords. Its a simple "here's what we do, don't worry about the technical part of how..."As you see in the profile Oliver had been in the space enough years to have #OGstatus.Hopefully, one day our paths will cross. Thank you sir for what you've done. I'd love to hear about your insights about how you run a tech company without talking about tech.#Trekkw2Ks #ThinkersnDoers #BlacksinTech #PoverB #BlacksinBlockchain #BlockchaininAfrica
