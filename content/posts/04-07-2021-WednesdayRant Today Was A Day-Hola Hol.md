But it was how my first line responded to a situation of one of my soldier.It should be noted that first half of this post was written the day of when I was still in my feelings. The following is 2 days after.TBC, I was griping in the moment. I do respect my first line and believe I'm learning from his style of leadership. He decision are logical and take into account things I sometimes miss.That being said. I'm staying for now and he did readdress the situation to help the soldier.#Trekkw2Ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #armylife#Trekkw2Ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB&nbsp;Post date 04-09-2021
