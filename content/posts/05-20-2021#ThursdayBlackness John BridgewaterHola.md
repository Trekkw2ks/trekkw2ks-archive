05-20-2021#ThursdayBlackness: John BridgewaterHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;✊&#127998;&#128079;&#127998;,Today's hand claps and raised fists goes to John Bridgewater. He is the CEO of Bluestone Technologies. I didn't know until reading his linkedIn profile the company was started in 2018. If you came in after 2018 then you missed the year known as the #CryptoWinter. That year made a number of #weakhands.I only bring that up because for me it's an indicator that John knows a thing or two about the space by starting a business then and still being here today. I wonder if he know Camella since he's operating out of the Caribbean?Nonetheless, I would like to say thank you sir for what you are doing in the space. I hope one day we can met in the real world on the island of Turks and Caicos. I hear the water is really blue there.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #BlockchainInTheCaribbean #BlacksinBlockchain
