BBSNajah pic1- Being a influencer in rhe space. Not posting the wallet or location anymore.Pic2Hester - Najah was suppose ro interview her. But got sick.&nbsp;At end saw here have a brief convo with Reggie. He wasnt suppose to talk with her, open case.Pic 3CJ - panel moderator with Katherine on panel with other lawyers.Takeaway thoughts:BBS is moving up the value chain. Having guests like Heister Pierce, Author Hayes, Corey Booker, etcThe concept ans implementation does not inherently include economic sovereignty or privacy. For most folks it's based on the TradeFi tools and financial instruments&nbsp;Hester Pierce doesn't have honest conversations when it comes to crypto. Questions are always scrubbed by her team.DAOs today will not exist in 10 to 15 yrs as the original form. If no legislation creates a separate business category following the core of what DAOs. They will never reach mass adoption. Or be coopted like DEFI now marketed as decentralized but centralized.&nbsp;
