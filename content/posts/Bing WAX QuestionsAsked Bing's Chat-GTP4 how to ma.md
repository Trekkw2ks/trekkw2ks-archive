Bing WAX QuestionsAsked Bing's Chat-GTP4 how to make a NFT book using WAX.To turn a regular book into a NFT using WAX protocol, you need to follow these steps:- Create a WAX Cloud Wallet account or use a self-managed WAX Blockchain account using Scatter or Anchor&sup2;.- Log in to AtomicHub's NFT Creator at https://wax.atomichub.io/creator&sup2;.- Create a new collection for your book NFTs. You need to provide a collection name, display name, photo, website URL, description and market fee&sup2;.- Create a new schema for your book NFTs. A schema is a layout for your NFTs that defines the attributes they have. For example, you can have attributes like title, author, genre, cover image, etc&sup2;.- Mint your book NFTs using the schema you created. You need to upload your book file (or an IPFS hash of it if it's larger than 2MB) and fill out the other attribute inputs. You can also specify how many copies of your book NFT you want to mint&sup2;.- Confirm the transaction and wait for your book NFTs to appear on AtomicHub&sup2;.Alternatively, you can also create and compile your own NFT smart contract using WAX-CDT and deploy it on the WAX blockchain. You can find an example of such a contract here⁴. However, this method requires more technical skills and knowledge of EOSIO development.Source: Conversation with Bing, 4/10/2023(1) The Ultimate Guide: How To Create NFTs on WAX - Medium. https://wax-io.medium.com/the-ultimate-guide-how-to-create-nfts-on-wax-bdf94fea64d0 Accessed 4/10/2023.(2) Create a WAX NFT - WAX Developer. https://developer.wax.io/en/tutorials/howto_simpleassets/nft_use.html Accessed 4/10/2023.(3) Create a WAX NFT - WAX Developer. https://developer.wax.io/en/tutorials/howto_simpleassets/nft_use.html Accessed 4/10/2023.(4) The Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to NFTs (and how to get them on WAX). link Accessed 4/10/2023.Ask how you read the book?To read a NFT book made on the WAX protocol, you need to have a WAX Cloud Wallet account or a self-managed WAX Blockchain account that owns or has access to the book NFT.
