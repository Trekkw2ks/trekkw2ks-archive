02-00-2021#MondayPush: What Are You Doing?Hola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based in a IG post I saw by #DoritoDave. He is the host of the podcast #SocialProof.In the video he makes a point about networking that I never thought about but makes total sense.&nbsp;Who do you take more seriously, someone who takes about what they are actively working or someone who only takes about what they want to do. The simple point is that same logic works in networking.&nbsp;People actively working on something attracts others who are engaged in their own project/business. I imagine part or it has to do with being able explain what your doing and the lessions you've learned from the experience.I provide more context in using my #ebooks as the example. But that's in the vlog. Enjoy&#128541;.#Trekkw2Ks #ThinkersnDoers #WhatAreYouWorkingOn #PoverB #LawofAttraction
