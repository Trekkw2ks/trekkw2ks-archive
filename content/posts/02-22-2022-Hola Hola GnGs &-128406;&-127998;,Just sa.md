2.22.2022Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Just saw this on Twitter and it had me cracking up when reading the comments.Now, the devil's in the details about the court case and type of bug McKimmy claims @OpenSea is responsible for which cause the loss of his #BAYC. You can look up the case number to read the details.For most onlookers, I guess it would make sense to sue if you believe you've been wronged. But IMO, this is just another sign of how the space, mentality, and narrative from the first decade are changing. For some this is a good thing because court cases make for better legal structures for operating a blockchain/crypto connected business. But for others like myself, this shows people don't care about the OG ideals of the space."Being your own bank" is turning into "why don't you have 24 hr #CustomerSupport." And the days of "don't trust verify" for personal security is losing to the convieniance of a☝&#127998;swipe.Personal accountability is Kool #whenmoon but sucks ass when scammed or getting rekt, then it delegated accountability.The point, this is want the cobblestone road to #MassAdoption looks like. &#129313; and &#128169; will be everywhere.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersandDoers&nbsp;link
