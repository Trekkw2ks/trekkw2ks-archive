02-2-2021#TuesdayBrand: Breaking The TrustHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,So, I wasn't sure if I was going to touch the @robinhood topic. But thinking about it this morning, I realized this is a #casestudy about #BrandEcho.As we see the #SocialContract being questioned by the masses and the aglos of #SoMe deciding what you can and can't say. The #WallStKid #Robinhood has arguably stirred the hornets nest.But who is that?To answer the question. Think about who was cut off with the tap of a button. Hint, it wasn't any of the #WallStDaddys.Bottom line, over the years the app that touted on Twitter and in ads campaigns, lines like "We are all investors. Our time is now" and "Let the people trade." They are coming back to hunt them.Why?I explain in the vlog.#Trekkw2ks #MaturedBrandEcho #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #WhalesVsGuppies #AllYouHaveIsTrust
