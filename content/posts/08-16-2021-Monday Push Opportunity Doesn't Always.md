08-16-2021#MondayPush: Opportunity Doesn't Always KnockHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is about opportunity and the epiphany I had during my #NatureDay yesterday. Basically, I went out to the woods and sat there for a few hours and thought about some things.&nbsp;Probably will find a way to make it a monthly thing, honestly.&nbsp;But anywho, I had a resent conversation with some folks over at a VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars) post. At the time I was just taking it as a simple chance to make a little extra crypto, lol.I cover more in the vlog about why the organization matters to me and what I realized.The point is at the time, I didn't see (or hear the knock) of opportunity. I'm actually going to cover more of this in tomorrow's&nbsp;#TuesdayBrand&nbsp;.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #VFW #Vets
