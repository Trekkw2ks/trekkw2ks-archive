Untitled@SmartTrekken&nbsp;link this is where you can get the browser plugin. Should be straight forward but if you need help with it ask @blockchaingandalf as he created norsu - which apparently means "elephant."&nbsp;Then you can see where we are at with the forums at http://network.tactokens.com/forums/ but mostly... its exactly what I shared on the post.&nbsp;Do keep in mind this is on HTTP - so if you try to access it through the https side of things it will not work. Sometimes I find chrome hates me and forces the http to https and shows a 404... and I have to manually switch from https back to http to get the page to work...&nbsp;its not perfect... its a work in progress. But the login will work if you have a web3 alias setup in your wallet.&nbsp;To setup a web3 alias, open your tac wallet.... and create one on the dashboard. Cost is 5 TAC.
