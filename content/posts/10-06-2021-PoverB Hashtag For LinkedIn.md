PoverB Group 10.6.21#PoverB&nbsp;GroupPee over B group so the idea came to me about 2 days ago for what I will do with the hashtag p over B. Four over two years now I've been using it as a hashtag within the LinkedIn post that I've been doing for vlogs.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I since I had the idea about starting a private group with a streamline crypto package for people who want to get into the space but not actually do the legwork or at least have the lowest amount of legwork required and the lowest amount of risk this to me seems to apply to the name.&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept being doing less physical work but still being productive when it comes to being able to build wealth. So the idea is to help people set up the crypto asset Management plan and then help them to set up all of the automated things that they could do that would get them in the space so this is a technical support thing not a fiduciary financial advisor service.&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea here is I can help you to automate how to get into the space and have stuff coming in and if anything breaks I can help you fix it. as well as there is a maintenance service that comes with it so you set up what you are looking to get involved in again I can't tell the end user what to get as far as the crypto is concerned but I can help them set up systems to have the acquiring of it automated so this will be bots this will be staking platforms like Celsius or block by. It will also be kyc style stuff. And this is because folks aren't going to do the work that it would be required for them to actually keep it out of kyc style platforms and not to mention having to deal with the CPA.&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is really geared towards the folks who won in but don't want to do all of the work and have to have at least a 12-month outlook on you can't touch anything for 12 months. aside from probably moving a asset from one wallet to the next or like from an exchange to a self custody wallet there's no cashing out because I did is to be able to have the lowest tax burden so that's the other part.So yeah that's the whole thing behind it that I'm thinking of it it could be called p over B Wells so productive of a busy wealth but because I'm going to do it as a private group I don't know I might stick with group or I might change it to productive over busy wealth and then I'm having like a whole nft idea behind it like if you're in and you know this is this is your membership thing I don't know that that would be an interesting thing that actually do to like to start the private group thing and be like hey I'm going to drop you at nft and the only way that you know you can validate that you're part of this is do you have the nft and this nft is what validates the membership. Now that I think about it too it'd be one of those like what Samsung was talking about the other day where it's you pay this amount and it gets you the nft which could then be airdropped into something like you pay for the subscription and if you paid for the 3-month joint that's one level nft that you get if you pay for the 12 month joint here is the other level that it gets you so then the question turns into how do you get that today and have like a reoccurring build on it like how would you get the nft to like mature with age aside from the fact that like you had it how would you get it to mature with age like visually see it that's something that I'm wondering.
