04-30-2021#FridayFocus: Remember the lessions&nbsp;Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is about life lessions. I think I've mentioned it before. But life can be a stumbling blocks of new and repetitive lessions.And when your an entrepreneur, some lessions can be life or death of your business. But all to often when go through the experience focused on the end result of getting past it. Negative experiences can be so emotionally packed we close our eyes to opportunities.I once heard someone say, if you learned nothing new in your first year of running a business, it means you didn't make enough mistakes.Makes way more sense after doing this for 2 plus year.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverBDate poster 05-01-21
