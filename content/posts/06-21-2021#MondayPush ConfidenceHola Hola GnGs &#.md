06-21-2021#MondayPush: ConfidenceHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;&#129470;,Today's vlog is based on a question my son ask. Most of over conversations are about what we're working on or working towards.But in the convo, he ask how was doing mentally and emotionally. I thought it was a very good question. I got me thinking about the differences in how I was raised vs the era now being more focused on feeling. I cover more in the vlog.The short is I feel more confident and stable emotionally and mentally in my intentions, decisions, and actions because their not based on external validation.I explain more in the vlog. But the takeaway for entrepreneurs is confidence comes with your ability to reach your goals and improving yourself not external validation.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #SgtTrekk #LifeAfterAIT
