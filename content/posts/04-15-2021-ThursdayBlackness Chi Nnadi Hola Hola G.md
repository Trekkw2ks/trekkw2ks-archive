04-15-2021#ThursdayBlackness: Chi NnadiHola Hola GnGs &#128049;&zwj;&#127949;,Today's &#127801;&#128079;&#127998;✊&#127998; go to Chi Nnadi. He is the founder and CEO of @Sela technologies. He actually wears many hats. As I discovered in his @linkedin profile he is also Solutions International. Both companies deal in using cutting edge technology with the goal of bringing transparency to second and third tier countries in like agriculture.&nbsp;As you can see in the profile Nnadi is no newbie to technology or working in Africa. If you in the states or some other part of the globe this may be a connection worth checking out.As always, I want to say thank you for the work you're doing Nnadi. I look forward to meeting you one day to learn more about your journey in technology and emerging markets.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #BlackinTech #BlacksinBlockchain
