11.13.21New bookHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,As the trek for knowledge and practical understanding in entrepreneurship continues, I recently started listening to Michael E. Gerber's The E-Myth Revisited on a friend's recommendation.I have to say for the first half of the book, I was kind of lost on the logic he was using to explain why small businesses failed. And why he promoted looking at the business as a franchise.&nbsp;And honestly, the consulting service he seemed to be providing in the story seemed to be geared toward making a physical product.I do agree that the #businessplane is must. So this post isn't just hating the book. Which I don't.After checking the publication date, I realized why the author's narrative didn't totally gel with me.&nbsp; It was written more than 4 years before the 08 recession. It was written before #ecommerce really expanded to impact the online business world. That was before #dropshipping became the Amazon side hustle. And most importantly (in my head anyway, lol) this was before people could mine crypto and flip NFTs set up as a business with out producing a physical product.Yes, I had to throw it into there &#128518;.If someone else read this book, I'm curious to know if you see all of what he says as applicable in a post C19 business environment.I still haven't finished it, but should be done by this weekend.&nbsp;#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #AudiobooksnBuild
