UntitledTAC - The Advertising CurrencyBy: Bruce BatesAbstractAn industry based cryptocurrency is a natural progression of cryptocurrencythat could help take money control out of the hands of elite bankers, out ofthe hands of project leaders, out of the hands of owners, and out of the handsof influencers as well as help solve long term volatility in currencies withoutthe need of &ldquo;stable coins&rdquo;. This requires changing the way cryptocurrencyvalue is currently calculated and moving away from supply and demandeconomics into an asset class valuation. The industry of marketing andadvertising has been selected to begin testing the idea of industry basedcurrency. This industry was selected due to its overwhelming control bymega-corporations as well as existing flaws within the marketplace thatindustry based currency can solve.\IntroductionThe world of marketing and advertising has a couple of flaws; either the costto promote is too expensive or the time consumption needed for growthdeters an owner from focusing on business operations. Neither of theseoptions are ideal for small to midsize businesses lacking the time and/orresources needed to flourish in such endeavors. The majority of the industry iscontrolled by three corporate giants: Google, Facebook (Instagram) andAmazon, which collectively hold 64.4% of the entire market causing a lack ofcompetitive availability while maintaining a financial stronghold over theindustry.That may not sound bad with 35% not controlled by them but when you bringin Microsoft, Apple and other megacorps, startup firms have no chance. Ontop of that marketing has become a giant auction where those able to paythe most win, thus excluding small and mid-sized businesses. As if that&rsquo;s notenough, consumers have become the product for marketing and advertisingagencies.\It is no secret that advertisers target their ads at specific audiences based onthe audiences online behavior. They are able to target age, gender, searchhistory, interests, connections and even whether or not a person has recentlylooked for similar items, memberships or similar types of data. The fact is, nomatter how private one makes themselves their behaviors are being tracked.On top of this, companies like Google and Facebook have long since doneaway with traditional &ldquo;customer service&rdquo; in favor of community support,meaning that if a real problem is happening, there is no one to turn to.People&rsquo;s voices are not being heard, considered, or taken into account when itcomes to advertising, targeting, or even quality.An industry based currency can level the playing field for small to mid-sizedbusiness owners by creating a much cheaper alternative to currentadvertising methods while also allowing businesses to profit and earn thevery currency that they will be spending.It allows people to take back control over their information, not throughprivacy but rather through inclusions while offering them rewards for beingthe product.\What is industry based currencyCurrently there are two types of currency in the world - inflationary currencyand deflationary currency.Inflationary currency tends to be government created currency or currenciescreated with a high level of manipulation through an infinite money supplywith an unlimited cap mixed with interest rate manipulations.\Deflationary currency on the other hand is usually limited in supply, valuedbased on supply and demand, and relatively easily manipulated by largeholders called whales.Neither inflationary or deflationary currency has proven to be an effectivetransparent form of currency and each is riddled with manipulations theaverage person has no control over while elites have a great deal of control inboth forms of currency.Industry based currency is something entirely different. Industry basedcurrency has a limited supply like that of deflationary currency, but it also hasa value cap. This means Industry based currency is not manipulated byinterest rates, by unlimited supply, nor by direct manipulations on a buy andsell market.Instead industry based currency obtains its value from the assets that itmaintains and from its limited supply while having a cap that should not belarger than the industry it was created for - in the case of TAC that would bethe industry of marketing and advertising.\Industry Based Currency ValuationCurrently the value of a cryptocurrency comes from several different things .1. Supply and Demand market2. Scarcity3. Claimed Fiat Backing4. UtilityScarcity creates a value in a supply and demand market for coins like bitcoin,utility plus supply and demand marketing creates a value for coins likeethereum, and claimed fiat backing gives values to tokens like Tether.Industry based currency combines scarcity with utility and takes supply anddemand out of the equation. It does this by obtaining its value from theassets created using the currency.If one examines ethereum they will find it allows assets to be created on theirplatform. Ethereum&rsquo;s value however is still derived from speculations of itsvalue on the open market.If one examines bitcoin, bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million. Thisgenerates a scarcity that makes people desire it, and the more scarce itbecomes the higher the value goes. This is because much like ethereum, itsvalue is still derived from speculations in an open market.TAC will have a limited supply like bitcoin, but it has a finite value that is notderived by speculations. Instead its value comes from a combination of all thetokenized assets created on its platform. Further, it has a limited value heightbecause the value of an industry based currency should never be greaterthan the value of the industry itself.\The marketing and advertising industry was worth approximately 1.8 trillionUS Dollars in 2020. That means no matter what value could be given to TAC,that value would never be worth more than 1.8 trillion dollars because itwould never be worth more than the entirety of the industry.TAC is beginning with a pre-mine of 100,000 coins and a total supply of100,000,000 coins. So if t represents the total TAC in current circulation, mrepresents the total industry market cap, s represents the max supply and MCrepresents the max market cap for current circulating supply a market cappotential equation would look like:MC = (m / s) * tMC = (1,800,000,000,000 / 100,000,000) * 100,000)MC = 1,800,000,000With a total potential market cap for circulating supply it has to beconsidered the percentage of the market the currency would hold - in thiscase roughly 1/400,000th of the market.This means that there are roughly 400,000 marketing based services thatmake up the marketing industry. This value will be known as c and SC is thesuggested market cap value giving a potential equation of:SC = MC * cSC = MC * (1 / 400,000)SC = 1,800,000,000 * (1 / 400,000)SC = 4500This formula can now be used to determine the base value of TAC currency.If BV represents the currency value, BV can be obtained by dividing thecirculating supply by the industry market cap:BV = SC / tBV = SC / 100,000BV = 4500 / 100,000BV = $0.045\This means the initial value and base value of TAC at time of launch should beroughly four and a half cents in US Dollars. This would be the absolute lowestvalue the coins should ever be if absolutely no assets were ever to exist on thechain.Determining the base value is an approximate value because it is an estimatethat there are 400,000 marketing based services that make up the industry.This creates a starting value but not an actual value.Rather than constantly adjusting the percentage of the market, it is morelogical to value an industry based currency based on the value of its totalassets.As more projects are built on the chain and more assets exist naturally thebase value is discarded and instead the value becomes the total of all assetvalues. The total market cap of all assets combined should never be morethan the value of the industry as a whole.Unlike inflationary currency whose value will always go down over a longperiod of time and unlike deflationary currency whose value will always go upover a long period of time, industry based currency will have times where itgoes up and times where it goes down. These are caused by changes in themarket, new project creation, changes in asset value on the chain, and totaldistribution of the currency.If tv represents a given token&rsquo;s value and ts represents a token&rsquo;s supply then itis easy to obtain that token&rsquo;s market cap. With each tokenl&rsquo;s market cap thenthe currency&rsquo;s actual value and actual market cap, represented as AV and AC,can be acquired.AV = ((tv * ts) + (tv * ts) + (tv * ts) + (tv * ts) &hellip;.) / tAC = AV * t\Industry Based Currency FeaturesAn industry based currency is one that is specifically intended fortransactional use. Because of this the assets on an industry based blockchainmust maintain a relative high speed.TAC was created with a 10-second block time that can maintain 100transactions per block making it one of the fastest blockchains currently inexistence, enabling smart contracts and other asset based projects to run at afaster, more optimal rate.Utilizing an industry based currency allows an ease of use for both end usersas well as developers, simplifying the ability to create smart contracts andassets without smart contracts.Smart contracts are not decentralized. They are contracts that interactbetween a wallet and user to ensure certain events take place. The meredefinition of decentralized equates no single point of failure. The wallet andcontract are both single points of failure. In short, there are times to utilizesmart contracts and other times where having access to a full blownblockchain API is the solution.TAC blockchain was created from a modified clone of wavesplatform andtheir tools, allowing developers to create smart contracts in the RIDE smartcontract language defined by wavesplatform.It also allows developers to create assets without a smart contract and createapplications in the programming languages they are most familiar with,adding a level of security that does not exist with most chains.\The protocol of TAC is Leased Proof of Stake. This means TAC is a Proof ofStake protocol which requires having a minimum of 1000 TAC coins in orderto earn from staking. That reward is 0.5 TAC per block. The more TAC one hasin their staking wallet, the more likely they are to be the creator of a block.The Leasing protocol of TAC allows users with less than 1000 TAC to take partin the rewards by leasing their coins to staking nodes. When a user leasescoins those coins are frozen in the node. This means the node operatorcannot withdraw them. The user can unstake their own coins at any time.The percentages that are owed to a user for leasing are based on the termssetup by the node operator. TAC does not pay out leasing rewards directly.The higher the balance of the node the greater the chance of generating thenext block. Because of this users should try to use smaller nodes to maintaindecentralization. In other words, unlike with other protocols, LPoS allows ALLusers to take part in the decentralization process, and if any node grows toolarge users can then lease their coins to other nodes thus maintaining abalance.As an industry based currency blockchain it is also important to allow theexchange of assets to take place with relative ease. It seems only logical thatan exchange exists solely for the main currency and assets of the blockchain.As a clone of waves TAC has a built-in decentralized exchange that providesexactly this feature. This means in the future an exchange will be releasedallowing advertisers and marketers to exchange assets to obtain marketingand advertising services in various places.Although this feature is built into the chain it will not be set up on TAC untilenough tokenized assets have been created on the chain. If there is just asmall number of projects on the chain this aspect is not entirely important inearly stages.\CDT - Content Discover TokenThe first project that is being released on TAC blockchain is called ContentDiscovery Token, or CDT.Currently in the area of search engines and search engine marketing, searchresults are in large part automated through algorithms that determine thebest sites to return to a user based on several factors.These algorithms, while created by people, run independently without userinput. One of the single most important factors in ranking websites isthrough the number of backlinks that website has. This is a huge flaw in thecurrent design process of search engines because it takes a large part of theuser&rsquo;s voice out of the process.\A search engine doesn&rsquo;t know nor care if every user visiting the top page in aresult hates the website in question. All it knows is that the website has lots ofbacklinks and relates to the category in question.There are some attempts to take human reviews into account with searchresults, but most of these attempts fail due to limits in the industry of reviews.Review sites currently tend to be geared towards sales and the salesexperience, and more often than not it&rsquo;s reviews of physical brick and mortarbusinesses.There are few places one can leave general reviews about something theydidn&rsquo;t spend money on.If a person downloads a piece of free software that didn&rsquo;t work as intendedthere is nowhere for them to complain. If a user has a terrible customerservice experience but never made a purchase, there are few places for themto complain.Even when there are places to leave reviews, unless those sites are recognisedas review sites by search engines they still just appear as backlinks andactually help the website in question in their &ldquo;organic marketing&rdquo;.TAC Content Discovery Network is set to fix that by creating a search enginethat is powered by human reviews and rating systems.\Content Discovery PluginTAC Content Discovery Network is set to fix that by creating a search enginethat is powered by human reviews and rating systems. The content discoveryproject is powered by a combination of the Content Discovery Plugin mixedwith CDT as rewards.The Content Discovery Plugin is a Chrome based web browser plugin thatallows users to review any web page on the internet.Users can give star ratings of the web page, can give thumbs up or thumbsdown for the page, can select keywords for the web page, can leave a textreview, select the content type, select the main category of the web page,and can select the language of the web page.\When a user first installs the plugin they have options to add their walletaddress as well as select categories that interest them. These settings arestored locally by the web browser.By adding their wallet address a user earns CDT tokens for every web pagethey end up reviewing.The categories are used to allow them to discover content via a button called&ldquo;random page&rdquo;.The plugin selects pages at random that others have already added based onthe selected user categories. This allows users to find and review content thatis specifically geared towards their interests.If no categories have been selected in the user options then the default is tofind random pages from all categories.Users earn 0.5 CDT for every new web page they add. They can add amaximum of 20 new web pages per day for a maximum amount of 10 CDTper day.\Adding a new web page is different than reviewing a page. It has less optionsthan a review. Specifically, the abilities to add a text review and to add a starrating do not exist when first adding a web page.These options are left out to make the process of adding new pages fast andeasy thus encouraging more usage.When a web page is first added it goes into an &ldquo;active page&rdquo; queue for othersto find. It remains in this queue for 72 hours. After the 72 hour period a pagecan only be found through the search engine.However a page owner or promoter can buy &ldquo;page boosts&rdquo;. These pageboosts cost 5 CDT for an additional 48 hour boost.When users use the &ldquo;random page&rdquo; feature of the plugin they get a morerobust review form, which includes the text review option as well as starrating options.Reviewing existing sites a user earns 0.01 CDT per review and can review amaximum of 1000 pages a day. This is a maximum of 10 CDT per day.This makes it so each user can earn a maximum of 20 CDT per day.\Content Discovery SearchThe entire purpose of the content discovery network is to build reviews tocreate a human powered search engine.Building a search engine powered by human reviews cannot be created untilafter a substantial database of web pages and reviews exists.Instead the content discovery network will begin by creating personalizedsearch engines for each user of the site.This means every time a review is created by a user, that review goes intotheir own personalized search engine with their own custom link.These personalized search engines are where the Content Discovery projectwill begin creating the algorithms for search rankings.\Content Discovery TrackingIn order to gather reviews and ensure we prevent cheating as best as possibleusers must create accounts with usernames, emails and passwords The onlyother data collected by the Content Discovery Plugin is a user&rsquo;s IP addressand the times they visit a website.Instead of personal data the plugin uses public information obtained fromuser&rsquo;s IP addresses for the purpose of advertising services. A person&rsquo;s IP isalready public information and actually gives a lot of information withouthaving to target or track users with cookies or through any other methods.An ip address can return continent, country, language, population of an area,the average income of an area, and countless other pieces of information nottypically readily available through existing advertising platforms.Using such data allows for users to maintain privacy while still offering highlyunique information as well as targeted traffic to advertisers. This informationwill only be available to advanced advertisers. Advanced advertisers areadvertisers who are paying for campaigns larger than $2500 US dollars.\CDT and TAC ValuationAlthough CDT is a premined token that will have a 100,000,000 token supply,it is also to be fair-released. This means the only way to obtain the token willbe through doing reviews with the Content Discovery Platform or bypurchasing it on the open market from those who did earn it that way.As such, the starting value is speculated at $0.001 per CDT. This is similar inrespect to the fact bitcoin started with no value and only after mining did avalue begin to take place.The value of CDT may go up over time, but an initial value of $0.001 seems likea fair estimated value.This means the total market cap of CDT would be 100,000,000 x 0.001 and thevalue of bitcoin would be the CDT market cap value divided by the circulatingsupply of TAC.Using the formulas already provided a TAC valuation can now be correctlydetermined:AV = (0.001 * 100,000,000) / 100,000AC = 1 * 100,000This makes the value of each TAC $1.00 at the time of TAC project launch.\TAC Transaction FeesDue to the fact that TAC is being created as an industry based currency, it hasto ensure the cost of a transaction is always lower than the value of a giventoken on the platform.Combine this with the fact that CDT is being fair-released and CDT payoutsmay happen often and in real-time, the most logical way to handletransaction fees is with a flat rate instead of based on a largest fees getprocessed first method as it works with blockchains such as Bitcoin andEthereum.At the current industry market cap the maximum any TAC could be worth is$18,000. That would be the value of TAC if all 100 million TAC were incirculation and the entire marketing and advertising industry was using TAC.When taking into account the maximum value the coin could be at thecurrent moment and combined with the fact the CDT value is $0.001 we setthe value of transaction fees to a flat 0.0000001 TAC per transaction.\TAC Project Timeline\TAC Summary:● Mining Type LPoS● Supply 100,000,000 TAC● Premine 100,000 TAC● Required Staking for Rewards 1000 TAC● Initial Value $1.00 USDCDT Summary:● Token Type Utility● Release Fair-Release● Supply 100,000,000 CDT● Initial Value $0.001
