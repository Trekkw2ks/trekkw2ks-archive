12.13.2021#RandomThoughts: Who's Handle Is It?Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,I keep saying this. Be leery of the people who promote any traditional company as a required part for #massadoption. This is double if not triple for&nbsp; #Meta aka Facebook.IMO, this article is a good example of why tech company like this are really friends to the end users.And before some of you bring up that she got the handle back.The point is that it was taken away with out any recourse. And it seems the only reason she was able to get it back was that the NYT started asking about. And that would've been bad PRLast point, expect a new ToS to come out soon about the right's they have and maintain when it comes to the creations of digital identities on this and all other platforms they own.@Tamra @marcus#Trekkw2ks #P0verB #Metaverse #DigitalID #Meta
