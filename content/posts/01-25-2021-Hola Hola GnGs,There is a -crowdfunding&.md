01-25-2021 Hola Hola GnGs,There is a #crowdfunding&nbsp;platform called the10kproject.com that I think more people should be aware of. The mission is simple, bring black entrepreneurs together with black none - accredited investors. In full disclosure, I'm a member. But that's not why I'm telling you about it.In short, I believe we need as many options as possible to change our individual and collective financial situation.It's a new century and building generational wealth is at the forefront of the minds of many black entrepreneurs and those will to invest as little as $100 in what could be the next McDonalds, Tesla, Facebook, or Pfizer.It's been tallied year for year that black startups received less than 1% of investment capital compare to their none black counter parts.During the #Obama administration, a little known legislation called the #JOBSACT came into existence, changing the game of rising money to start, sustain, and scale a startup or established business.In 2021, raising capital using #RegCF will go from $1 million to $5 million. Mic drop...In 2020, Samson Williams spilled the tea about customers having more money than VCs. And the10kproject now has 10 thousand plus registered users ready to take advangtage of the new #SEC approved to raise funds.I strongly encourage you to check out what #the10KProject is doing. This decade will bring change.#trekkw2Ks #newdecade #YourReady&nbsp;
