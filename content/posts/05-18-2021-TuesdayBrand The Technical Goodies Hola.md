05-18-2021#TuesdayBrand: The Technical GoodiesHola Hola GnGs ,Today's vlog is more of a promo about the new service I've added to the company. It's called #Ghostminting. I wanted to share since I spent 5 hours on a @zoom call learning how to do some extra things on the Wax.io market place. Side note, I wanted to build @samson's #NiftyAasNFT collection on Wax (based on #EOS blockchain.) But I made the mistake of listening to his wanting it Ethereum based when he didn't know anything about the technical differences. Lesson learned... But I digress. The point is I know, I've been talking about the book for a while. The words are done, I promise. The last creative part is curating the final pieces for the cover art. And thanks to my guy #3Dough, I now know how technically execute the idea I had in my head about the #ebook with collectable NFT cover art. I really love my network. They may not look "professional" but they will run rings about the suites and tie folks when it comes to the technical side.&nbsp;#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB&nbsp;
