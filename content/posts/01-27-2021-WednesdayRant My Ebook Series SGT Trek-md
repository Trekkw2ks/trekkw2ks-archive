01-27-2021#WednesdayRant: My Ebook Series SGT TrekkHola Hola&nbsp;Today's rant is about about my other ebook SGT Trekk. I'm about 99% done. It's crazy to think it took me over a year to write 21 pages. I have to thank the #pointyhairedguy @samson for sparking the fire on this one.Funny thing, it was reading @kenn ebook about blockchain that actually got me to finish it. Now, I just need to get the proofing done.&nbsp;I feel humbly excited yet anxious. Why? Because the book isn't about being a know it all soldier. This is part of my legacy, #digitalasset based on my intellectual capital. And I'm curious to see how this grows over time and how it will affect my #BrandEcho.TBH, I don't see people catching on to the book are the cover art right away. And that's ok. This isn't about upfront money.&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch the whole vlog because I talk about the bigger picture and who's blockchain I'm using to make my NFT cover art.@tamr @chris @benj @jonath @ryan @kather @te-er @Raman @Tonya @Kei @tavonia @ansy#trekkw2ks #selfpublish #army #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB
