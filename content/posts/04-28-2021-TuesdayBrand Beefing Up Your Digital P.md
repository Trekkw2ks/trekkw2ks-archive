04-28-2021#TuesdayBrand: Beefing Up Your Digital PresenceHola Hola GnGs &#128104;&#127998;&zwj;&#127908;,In today's vlog I meant to say Tuesday Brand but I was lost in the umpteenth take of it. Any who, the post is a little insight on how I've scaled up my #DigitalPresence by integrating automation in content distribution. And how it helps in building a #BrandEcho.TBC, automation is only a tool to help you. What I'm focusing on here isn't about the quality of your content and or added value. But being able to increase how much you put out.I use two platforms #IFTT and @socialpilot. #InFullDiscloser, neither of these companies have paid me or asked for this vlog. Now that I think about it, 9 times out of 10 they have no clue who I am and what I doing with their service, but I've tagged them nonetheless, lol.The takeaway, integrating some level of&nbsp;#SoMe&nbsp;(social media) automation helps grow your brand awareness. How? Honestly, because most folks aren't about spending hours posting manually. So the convenience of automating things allows you to use that time more productively.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #SaveTimeDate posted 04-29-2021
