12-5-2020Monday Push: I Don't Got Time, Stop TalkingHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Well it's the first full week of the new year... Not everything has gone to plan. My @guapcoin giveaway didn't get to start off the Jan 1st like I wanted. My book about BrandEcho still doesn't have a final title yet.But it's not the end of the world.Why?Because I made it to another day to do more than just talk about taking action. I said it last year, I'm doubling down on content.&nbsp;This week I showcase my new vlog intros. And that's just one of many things to come. As I told @cannabusnurse, @linkedin is going to be my play ground in 2021.The point, some of you need to stop talking about making change and start doing. This decade is going to bring many opportunities. But if all you're going to do is about.I respectfully ask that you stay over there with other people who just talk about doing shit.Trekkw2Ks MondayPush PayAttention GettingPassed
