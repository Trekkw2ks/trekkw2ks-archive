10-09-2020Friday Focus: Lets Write A BookHola Hola G&amp;Gs,Those of you who catch my vlogs on a more regular basis may have heard me mention working on a ebook. It was in part inspired by reading Ken borsak's book Earning Money In A Jobless World: The Promise of AI, A New Currency and Blockchain, @samson (he's always in there somewhere), and my TuesdayBrand series building a brandvoice to attract 1 of the 3 types of communities.So, what does this have to do with the FridayFocus theme. Simple, there is always something going on in life. There is never a perfect time for most of us riding the buck called entrepreneurship. Are there ideals times when the stars in the heavens align?&nbsp; Yes. But for the most part you have to remember with everything going on you still have to focus on completing the small steps that make the task complete, bringing you one day closer to the bigger goal.&nbsp;This is my first ebook and there are some many lessons to learn in the process. For now, the thing that matters most is setting down for at least one hour a day and writing out these chapters.hhimtrekk thefocus selfpubishing firsttime #2020AintReady ThinkersnDoers PoverB Trekkw2Ks #3TsCs
