Sponsorship PlansCBTV was started by CryptoBlood in 2014, making it one of the longest running crypto YouTube channels to date. The channel covers education and current events around cryptocurrency.&nbsp;Over the years the audience has grown and community members have gone from co-hosting live streams to having their own segments. Our goal is to provide the community with qualitative and quantitative information covering the adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency while having fun and being down to earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, it's not just about building wealth off centralized platforms, but helping the community learnzeg how to use and keep their privacy and economic sovereignty.
