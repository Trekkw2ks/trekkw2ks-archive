11-23-2020Monday Push: What's 4 Years?Hola Hola GnGs,Today's vlog is influenced by two different people. First is by the host of a podcast called Social Proof. And the second is by Samson. Actually, it's what the guest said that reminded me of something Samson says.I remember when people told me, I should go to school for the blockchain thing. I'm approaching my third year of jumping into the space two-feet head-first. I can look at it now and feel confident in not going the school route. Even though there were no formal degree programs when I changed career paths, lol.I make the point in the video, stuggling for 4 years to get your business going is nothing. People going for degrees don't complain about not make any money. That's a four year head start for you. I explain a little more in the video.hhimtrekk MondayPush Marines Soldiers OJT CollegeDegree HandsOnThinkersnDoers Trekkw2Ks #2021IsNearlyHere PoverB
