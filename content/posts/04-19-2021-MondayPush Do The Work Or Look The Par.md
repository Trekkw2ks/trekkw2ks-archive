04-19-2021#MondayPush: Do The Work Or Look The PartHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog came to me late Monday evening. I guess the universe has reason in hiding this thought from me in the morning.&nbsp; This is why I like making day of content. I'm always amazed at some of the things that come up last minute.Nonetheless, let me get back to the point. I've had a few conversation about how things are developing in the crypto space. Which got me thinking about why I "show up" to make the content slash push the business. In case you've missed my 2 years and change worth of vlogs. I help small companies develop their #BrandEcho. DM to learn more.The takeaway of this vlog is understanding why your pushing yourself? Is it just about the&nbsp; accolades based on looking the part? Or is it about building something that is beyond you?#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoer #PoverBPost date 04-20-2020
