10.28.25Hola Hola G&amp;Gs &#128406;&#127998;,Another #Trekkw2ksLive has come and gone. Today's takeaway is a culmination of twitter posts that #ScratchMyBrain covering topics like Trump pardoning CZ (former co-founder of Binance) and the DOJ and Treasury dept securing 127,000+ BTC from a pig slaughtering facility in Cambodia for the USA.It's been an interesting week. But I digress.The takeaway, there is a ultimate game of Monopoly being played on the masses, but with real money, narrated as economic warfare between the east (China) and west (USA) over AI chips, soy beans sales, Trump's tariffs, and the coming WW3.&nbsp;However, IMM, that noise drowns out people (like ME) asking the two-part question at the core of the shift we are experiencing, from a mono-polar to a multi-polar world.The question(s), who's version of digital money wins the future? The US is upgrading to digital debt instruments based on financial engineering, meaning no real world asset backing. Meanwhile, China is building digital monetary instruments and opening gold vaults along the #OneBeltOneRoad routes globally to back the digital YUAN. Countries from LATAM to African and South Asia are seeing the writing on the wall.The American leadership still operates on the decades old Cold War era mentality of winner take all, or what I call the Highlander mindset. Boomers (think John Bolton and Hillary Clinton) whole heartedly believe in what Ramirez (Sean Connery) said "there can be only one" (Highlander 1986). Addintionaly, can't forget the Merica types, whole different breed, but same base mentality. American must stay the world reserve currency at all cost.History shows us England eventually had to recognize that the US "got the juice now" (Juice 1992). And acted accordingly to the reorg of the world power roster. In the States, we're bombarded by mainstream financial news reports about stablecoins and crypto. Resulting in pocket watching segments about Michel Sailor (CEO of MicorStrategy) BTC. buys. Brian Armstrong (Coinbase CEO) statements like "crypto and stablecoins are the tools that will update the global financial system." and&nbsp;"It's not a debate anymore. And Zelle getting into the stablecoin game thanks to the direction of its parent TradFi consortium.The second part of the question, after the dollar falls from grace, what does America become after losing dominance, will it reinvent or devour itself? Honestly, I have no clue.&nbsp;Going back to Armstrong's hubris to speak for the world. So why would the #GlobalSouth agree to use an inflationary digital money they have no agency over and that has nothing backing it? In what universe would that make sense to use that as a future of a sustainable monetary system?#CryptoUnc #Tether #ScratchMyBrain #Bitcoin #EconomicSovereignty #FinancialFreedom #Stablecoins #USDC #USDT&nbsp;AI versionHola Hola G&amp;Gs &#128406;&#127998;,&nbsp; Another #Trekkw2ksLive down, another wild news cycle that #ScratchMyBrain.&mdash; from Trump pardoning CZ (Binance) to the DOJ and Treasury Dept locking down 127,000+ BTC from a pig slaughtering facility in Cambodia.The takeaway: There&rsquo;s a global game of Monopoly unfolding, played with real money and spun as economic warfare between the East  and West (AI chips, soybean sales, tariffs, and WW3). But beyond the noise lies a core shift: from a mono-polar to a multi-polar world.The question: whose version of digital money wins the future? The U.S. is pivoting to digital debt instruments backed by nothing tangible, while China builds digital currency underpinned by gold along its #BeltandRoad routes. Nations from LATAM to Africa see where this is heading.American leadership still clings to a Cold War &ldquo;Highlander&rdquo; mindset &mdash; winner takes all.&nbsp;Boomers (think John Bolton and Hillary Clinton) wholeheartedly believe  "there can be only one".&nbsp;Additionally, can't forget the Merica 2.0 types much louder, with the same base mentality. America must dominate the world at all costs.But history reminds us that power shifts. Britain eventually conceded the U.S. &ldquo;got the juice now,&rdquo; and adapted.Stateside, financial media is selling stablecoins as salvation. We get non-stop coverage of Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy CEO) stacking BTC, Brian Armstrong (Coinbase CEO) insisting "crypto and stablecoins will update the global financial system&mdash;debate's over," while Zelle moves into the stablecoin game at the direction of its TradFi overlords.&nbsp; This brings me to the second, more profound question: After the dollar falls from grace, what does America become? Will it reinvent itself, or devour itself? I can't predict the exact outcome. This is why the hubris of statements like "crypto will update the global financial system" misses the point. Why would the #GlobalSouth agree to use an inflationary digital monetary system they have no control over, backed by nothing?What do you think?#CryptoUnc #Bitcoin #EconomicSovereignty #FinancialFreedom #Stablecoins #USDC #USDT
