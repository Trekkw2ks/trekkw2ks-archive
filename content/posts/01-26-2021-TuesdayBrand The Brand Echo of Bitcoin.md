01-26-2021 #TuesdayBrand: The Brand Echo of BitcoinHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's is based on a @samson conversation and epiphany I had about #BTC. No we're not getting into price talk per say but it does relate.So, since the passing of #MFDoom (Rap Artist), I've been questioning my model to build a brand echo was wrong. Well not wrong, but the time preference was off which effected the what and how. Which made the case studies I was going to use in my ebook Brand Echo: Every Brand Has A Voice, Who's Echoing Yours kinda irrelevant.Why?Because they didn't meet the requirement of time to develop a #MaturedBrandEcho. This is where Samson's line of "the overnight success story is based on how are you grind the first 10 years..." Now connect that with the fact that nothing has been in the space as long as Bitcoin.If it's still not clicking, listen to the vlog where I go into more detail about the significance of this when is comes to driving a brand narrative with out a driver.#trekkw2ks&nbsp;#ThinkersnDoers&nbsp;#⛪ofBitcoin #PoverB&nbsp;
