9-16-2020Tuesday Brand: What Community Language Is Your Brand Speaking? Pt1Hola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's post is the result of a&nbsp; @linkedin post and serveral convos.The starting point was a post by @Samson covering his views on crowdfunding. I agree btw. His 3 Cs (consumer, customer, and community) are a little different than mine.&nbsp;My convo with @carl was what expanded how I saw a community, in the branding context. Thank you good sire for making me think.&nbsp;And then early this morning (my time) there was my zoom with Colin. I had to flush out the spoke and wheel model of how storytelling (branding) relates to type of community language a companies speaks and their differences..&nbsp;If you still don't know what I'm talking about? Then just listen to the vid.hhimtrekk tuesdaybrand goodconvo branddev connecting&nbsp; brandvoice communitybuilding #2020aintready PoverB ThinkersnDoers Trekkw2Ks
