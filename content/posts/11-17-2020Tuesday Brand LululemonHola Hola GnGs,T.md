11-17-2020Tuesday Brand: LululemonHola Hola GnGs,Today's post is based on something that happened last week. I got to witness @lulu #BrandEcho in action. I doubt they call it that but it was still interesting to watch.And no Lulu did start making anything blockchain or crypto.&nbsp; However, this experience shows that taking more than a decade of building a brand is working. This goes to what @sam says about overnight success. Looking into their digital foot print, the progress of their brand image validates my view that projecting a brand voice is only part of the equation in building a community. This is something I see a number of blockchain related companies missing, the brand echo.In the video I tell the story and explain how it relates to companies in the space.#HHImTrekk #TuesdayBrand #yogapants #customers #consumers #clients #BrandDevelopment #Branding #2020AintReady #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB
