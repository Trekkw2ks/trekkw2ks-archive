06-18-2021#FridayFocus: Technology Sucks But I'm Still DeterminedHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is a simple truth about technology. First let me hashtag the subtitle #TechnologySucks.Now, here's the caveat in context as to why.&nbsp;As I mentioned in the vlog, I did a 5 hr zoom with my guy 3D. Putting in the #attentionequity to learn a technical process like creating a NFT sucks ass. And is something most people don't care to do, like my #unofficialmentor Samson, lol. Hence why he used my #GhostMinting service to do #NiftyAasNFT on OpenSea.But I digress, the point is technology offers a number of convieniances but does always work as expect. As the entrepreneur, you have to be determined to find the work around.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #SgtTrekk&nbsp;
