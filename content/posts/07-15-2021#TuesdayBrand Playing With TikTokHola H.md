07-15-2021#TuesdayBrand: Playing With TikTokHola Hola GnGs &#128105;&#127998;&zwj;&#128187;&#128526;,So today's vlog is a little update on what I've been doing to get the word out about my ebook SGT Trekk: Life After AIT, When The Real Shit Starts. I should add, I wasn't sure about the sub-title on this one but while writing the copy (which was after making the vlog) it made the most sense.As I keep saying it's trial and error to figure out what works and what doesn't. I'm using this time to expand my content for @TikTok. Bonus points is the one micro piece is then reused for 3 other other #SoMe (social media) platforms. I break down more of that in the vlog for those interested in learning how to repurpose content.Another thing I find interesting about using tikky-tok is the number of people form my past starting to follow me on the different platforms. More on that in the vlog too.The takeaway is the same old message, don't be afraid to try some new shit. You'll be surprised what you learn and the possibel connections made.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #SgtTrekk #LifeAfterAIT
