21.02.2021Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Scrolling threw #Twitter this morning and saw this tweet by Lopp. Three things came to mind.1️⃣ financial advisors are working to counter the open nature of Bitcoin/crypto. For some it's about job security while for others it's about regulatory clarity. But then there are those who've been in the industry for up to 30 yrs. So, they have no clue what's the difference between Bitcoin and bitcoin.2️⃣ The wealthy boomers he's talking about don't care about #economicsovereignty. The current &#129313; money system works just fine for them. They feel safe by putting the control/risk in someone else hands cause they can always sue when it doesn't go how they want.3️⃣ In near real time, we're watching the original #P2P intention and function of cryptos be ostracized by #WallStDaddy types and gov agencies. It saddens &#128546; me when I talk to newbies and the think you have to ask for permission to access the space.last thought, the walled garden always looks nice and feels safe when you have fancy wall paper.
