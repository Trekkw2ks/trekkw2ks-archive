04-29-2020Wednesday Rant: How Can I Help?&nbsp;Hola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's #vlog is the result of what I call my Corona Pivot (#CoPiv) with my company Trekk Smart Consulting.&nbsp;Believe it or not I've found a #silverlining to corona.&nbsp;What is that you ask?&nbsp;Simply put, learning to step my game up in providing a more practical service to the blockchain/crypto space. I'm focusing on the #ThinkerandDoer #solopreneurs, #startups, and #smallbusinesses who need help to either define or revamp their brand.&nbsp;In practical terms here's what I'm promising:&nbsp;1. FREE downloadable questionnaire to help you identify/clarify what your brand is. (Available by the end of the week).&nbsp;2. I will open Thursdays on my calender for a scheduled #free 60 min Zoom talk. This will be open until the end of July.&nbsp;3. The vlogs will include more practical breakdowns and free info.4. IAH, I can't make you a million brand out the box, but working to together could be that start of it.#hhimtrekk #wednesdayrant #help #valueproposition #bizdev #realtalk #ThinkersnDoers #2020aintready #PoverB #brandbuilding #letstalk #storytelling&nbsp;
