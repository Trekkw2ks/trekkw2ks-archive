12-13-2021#WednesdayRant: Encouraging CreativityHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on a DM convo, yesterday. I recently discovered #PLRs content (yes, I'm late) and asked a friend share their thoughts on using these digital products.Yes this would be a new source income, but this new tool in content creation has more benefits when I put it through my legacy filter. Which is what I was explaining to my friend and seeing if what I wanted to do made sense when it came to my business, encouraging my kids to be creative, and teaching them the technical skills to monetize their creativity.For those new to my vlogs, during the summer time I started saying daily mantras. One of them is "I'm building the legacy blue print for my grandkids's grandkids." The last few months have been an interesting discovery of trails of informational &#127838; crumbs to opportunities towards the goal.I give more details in the vlog. Hopefully, it helps you #ThinkersnDoers.Terra Dorsey Ashley Silvana Naj Ryan benjamin mckenzie stephen#trekkw2ks #legacy #NFTs #creativity #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #IntellectualCapital
