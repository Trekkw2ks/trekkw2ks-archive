4-09-2020Thursday Blackness: @Michelle&nbsp;Hola Hola G&amp;Gs,Today's #vlog is to highlight and raise a fist for the work of Michelle Chivanga of capital solutions. I had the chance to met her when at the Blockchain Africa conference put together by @bitcoinevents.Side note, this recording is from the beginning of April, before lockdowns and #socialdistancing because of #corona was a thing thing.Nonetheless, I had a great time at #BAC2020 and look forward to next year's event.#hhimtrekk #thursdayblackness #blacksinblockchain #Africa#ThinkersnDoers #PoverB&nbsp;
