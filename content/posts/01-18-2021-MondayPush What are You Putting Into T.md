01-18-2021 MondayPush: What are You Putting Into The Digital UniverseHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,My new operational environment dictates, I have to find new ways to put my desires into the universe. I'm referring back to my CueCardChallenge. This experience has made me realize I also need to work on the digitaluniverse side.I think the same applies to you ThinkersnDoers out there. You may not like making vlogs or struggle to write content. But today is a new day and you need to put your goals into the universe.&nbsp;Of course I talk more about it in the vlog. The take away is even with distractions you have to find a way to still put your goal out there.&nbsp;Trekkw2Ks GetTheWordOut PoverB
