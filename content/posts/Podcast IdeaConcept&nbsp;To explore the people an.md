Podcast IdeaConcept:&nbsp;To explore the people and projects building&nbsp; decentralized web3 technologies&nbsp; and services with a concentration on marginalized groups in tech.Formate: in person (where possible) and virtual conversations running 30 to 45 mins long. Record video (when possible) and audio.Possible Name:- Voices of the Webolution- Welcome to the Webolution- The WebolutionQuestions: questions ideally go from typical framing questions to fun stuff. The fav song(s) could be a staple question &#128071;&#127998;.-Name two of your fav songs?-Ask at the beginning or end of showSome people are better at specking than others and need leading question to get answers out of them. But I'd still like to be able to browsing the convo of not just being blockchain/crypto.Convo ideally involves the technical aspects and not dominated by monetary gains.Podcast GuestsShawn of StorjImari WilsonNicolas from Tellor&nbsp;BrittanyTolaWes Wilson foot ball guyYoga bossRick DudleyNicole linkedInMelinie (NFT)Library/OdessiJasmin DJLeroy3DSeith Mine Your BizBitcoin ZayDr Jamar MontgomeryMichael Williams DeFiPhillyChris BlecTavonia EvansBlue Moon
