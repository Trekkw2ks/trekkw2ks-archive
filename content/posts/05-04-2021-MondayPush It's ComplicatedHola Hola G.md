05-04-2021#MondayPush: It's ComplicatedHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on my excursion into #DeFI yesterday. There was a lesson that cost me a number of hours. I realized it X number of hours later that the original plan would've taken less time and was much easier.Another example of trial and error. But I'm glad for the experience because I can't have people pay me for how I think and what I say if I have no experience in it, right?This morning while reviewing the process, I was reminded of a classic army saying . The acronym KISS "Keep It Simple Stupid" is applicable to the entrepreneur world too. Why because sometimes we tend to over complicate things. Last night, that was definitely me, lol.&nbsp;The takeaway for this Monday Push, sometimes we over complicate things and psych ourselves out when if comes to reaching a goal. I get more into it in the vlog.&nbsp;#Trekkw2Ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #KISSDate posted 05-04-2021
