1.27.2022Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,So, remember that market correction over the weekend. The #FUD was at ATH. It was blood int he streets and some folks were having flash backs of the 2018 #CryptoWinter &#129398;. #Russia banning crypto was part of the&nbsp; explanation being pushed out in the crypto news cycle.Oh no, the Russians are coming for crypto, the Russians are coming for crypto. &#127939;&#127998;&zwj;♂️.That narrative made sense for a lot of the naysayers of crypto and the anti-Russian good old boys and girls. Why? Because in the west, we're conditioned to hate the &#128059;.&nbsp; I don't hate the bear and plan to visit one day.The irony in this story is that it wasn't the government that proposed the crypto wide ban. It was the #CentralBankofRussia that made a report detailing why it should be banned. And since publishing the report they're lobbying the parliament to enact the suggested legislation.Who would've thought, central banks do what central banks do &#128587;&#127998;&zwj;♂️; propose and uphold policies that keep people in the #walledgarden and protect the industries they control. So in other words it really doesn't matter the language the name the central bank is written in. They all use the same playbook. And in case you forgot in the last 6 months, the American central bank, IMF, OFAC, and WTO all put out reports telling governments why crypto was bad for their economy and financial system.,Makes you wonder, who's the bad guy really?Last thing, I get it people have the memory o a &#128032;. In 6 months I'll be making the point again that Russia is NOT banning cryptos. Also, if other indicators are right, there will be a stablecoin meets mining play sanctioned by the Kremlin before 2025 that will rock the SWIFT system.&nbsp;These three articles explain why the Russian government isn't going to ban crypto:1.&nbsp;link2.&nbsp;https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-proposes-wide-ban-on-cryptocurrency-use-trade-mining/3.&nbsp;https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-may-allow-crypto-mining-and-gold-backed-stablecoins-lawmaker-says/#Trekkw2ks #Crypto #P0verB #PokeTheBear #CentralBanks&nbsp;
