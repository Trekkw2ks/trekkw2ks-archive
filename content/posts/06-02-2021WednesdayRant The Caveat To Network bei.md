06-02-2021WednesdayRant: The Caveat To Network being Your Net WorthHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;&#128583;&#127998;&zwj;♂️,So, today's vlog is something I've talked about before. And is definitely worth bringing up again. One of the things you constantly hear when being an entrepreneur is your "net work is your net worth." But what you don't get told about are some caveats to that. For example, friends and family.That's my focus today. It took me some time to understand this one, honestly. But the quicker you learn this lesson the better you will be in running your business.The takeaway is don't depend on your network of family and friends to make your business function or grow. They aren't your target audience. Taking them out of the equation now saves relationships later, IMO.Last thing, you can download the ebook from @amazon @ Bit./ly/sgttrekkebook#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #LifeAfterAIT #SgtTrekk
