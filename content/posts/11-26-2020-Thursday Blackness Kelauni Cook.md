11-26-2020Thursday Blackness:Kelauni CookHola Hola GnGs,Today's raisedfistand hattip goes to a young lady a little north of me in Pennsylvania. She is the founder of Distributed49 which is a blockchain education and consultancy company hosted at @caeirgni Mellon. And she the founder and brains behind Black Tech Nation. Kelauni does more as you'll see in the profile.As I've been saying for how long, the point is to highlight and show appreciation to the black faces across the globe doing their part to show. BlackPeople are more than consumers. We are innovators, creators, and influncers.&nbsp;Thank you Kelauni for what you have done and will do.hhimtrekk ThursdayBlackness BlacksInTech BlacksDigitaWakanda
