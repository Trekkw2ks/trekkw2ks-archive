And one of the things to used to coral people would be&#128178;. As Samson likes to call it #programablemoney.Programmable money is old news to me. But what caught my attention was how it would be sold to the masses. That would namely be CBDCs (or as I call them #BlueDogs) and #inclusion.I bring the other in the vlog.
