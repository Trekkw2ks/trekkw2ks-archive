02-26-2021#FridayFocus: Checking My EgoHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is something I wanted to talk about last but didn't fit in till today. Its more ever green content anyway.As I've mentioned before entrepreneurship not for the timid or weak in mental fortitude. But what's that mean in plan English.&nbsp;Simple, you have to talk&nbsp; your shit about what your pushing and embrace the rejection with two arms of disbeliever n haters.Arguably, that is the easy part. The other trap I don't hear too many folks talk about is checking your ego. There's a saying that goes "you're your worst critique..." IMO, ego plays a major roll in that.Why?&nbsp;Because either your a #OverCockyAhole who's easily intimidated by the success of others. Or you have #ImposterSyndrome, second guessing yourself and added value based on your skill set and knowledge based.The takeaway is neither state is healthy and in the long run hurts your business. This is me taking my own advice in all honesty.#trekkw2ks&nbsp;#ThinkersnDoers #BelieveInYourself #CheckTheEgo #PoverB
