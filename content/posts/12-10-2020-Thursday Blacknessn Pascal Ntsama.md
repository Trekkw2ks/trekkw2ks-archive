12-10-2020Thursday Blackness:&nbsp;Pascal NtsamaHola Hola GnGs,Today's raised fist goes to&nbsp;Pascal Ntsama. He was the founder of Coincentix Capital, where he and his team focused on the education of digital assets and blockchain development.&nbsp;Pascal has since moved on to helping NGOs use technology to tap into new avenues of raising funds.I've mentioned it before. I don't know most of the people on this list of #100BlacksinBlockchain.&nbsp; As is the case here Pascal is working on Menergi. But it doesn't diminish the work he did do to help educate people.I would just like to say thank you sir for what you've done. Best of luck with helping NGOs around the world.hhimtrekk ThursdayBlackness BlacksinTech BlackFounder HelpItGrow ThinkersnDoers #2021IsAlmostHere PoverB
