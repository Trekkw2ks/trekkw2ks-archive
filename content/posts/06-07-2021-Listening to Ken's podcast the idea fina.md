06-07-2021Listening to Ken's podcast the idea finally came to me about how to do a social credit.If I make mfts that would work for the brand echo. I could use them as ways to sell, announcements I did flapping dam. No paragraphs I can sell them as a dollar and make a thousand of them and idea would be by 1 and I'll shout you out on a one of my social media platforms. if you want to be shouted out on more than one then you have to be it will be a higher price or if you like $2.F. That idea also comes up about using it for the podcast. In order to get the podcast you have to buy the nft badge for brand echo and so just this is just an idea to experiment around with I'm not a hundred percent certain how it will work or how long it would take to actually like gain traction. I think that's going to be a direction to go in.Because the other thing that I thought about is to get the website up for the memes and so what I will do with the memes campaign for the website is you get announcements.Basically the meme web site will hold all of the mean that I'm using in the campaigns for crypto jobs list myself and for what you call it white coin and so then I have an advertisement that if you want it hey guess what this is how you have to purchase getting listed on this site or mentioned on the site and it'll be under the hashtag of brand echo that's the direction I'm going to go in with this going forward.The idea is to use the cards are used in the NFC tokens or badges I'm not a hundred percent certain yet on which way to go but that'll be for doing the brand echo and that way you can get shouted out on the website you can get named on the social media yeah that's the basic idea of how I'm looking to go forward with that again not certain if it would actually take off as an idea and it would definitely be different price points for the number of things that you get announce or mentioned on.
