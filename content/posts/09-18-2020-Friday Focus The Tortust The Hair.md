9-18-2020Friday Focus: The Tortust &amp; The Hair&nbsp;Hola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's vlog is based a convo (as most of these are), I had yesterday.I'm the first to say I don't come from the traditional back ground of brand development. If there's even a traditional path of anything in this day and age.To sum it up, we talked about a job posting for a notable company in the space. They recommend Igice it a shot. I explained my dought in applying for the position, how I see branding and marketing as something a fair number of folks don't get in the space.&nbsp;Not saying I know it all either. But I do know there is a change happening in how communities are built around brands. During my drive in I thought more about bringing me to the Tourtust and Hair story.Some folks are here for the quick growthhack, in and out in 5. While others look to establish something that goes beyound them.So which are you, the tortust or the hair?Post Date: 9-23-2020hhimtrekk FridayFocus drivetime legacy bagchaser ThinkersnDoers building&nbsp; PoverB trekkw2ks #2020aintready drillweekend
