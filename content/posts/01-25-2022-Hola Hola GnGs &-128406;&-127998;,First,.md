1.25.2022Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,First, I love my #mom. She is old school practical, lol.She sent me a card for my birthday &#127881;&#127881;&#127881;. More about that in another post. But in the card was this article.Now my mom doesn't know heads or tails of BTC from LTC or XRP. But she does knows crypto is connected to some of the work I do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even tho she can't explain what I do. She still likes to brag to friends and family that I never ask her for money and I can make money anywhere I go.I've never looked to force crypto on my mom. Maureen L. Murat, Esq.&nbsp; always says "meet people where they are". For most people, hearing about something on the news is one thing but seeing it in your neighborhood adds a new level of relevance.I think the clipping was her saying, she sees the adoption and it's something practical that she understands.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;#Trekkw2ks #LocalNews #Clearwater #P0verB&nbsp;
