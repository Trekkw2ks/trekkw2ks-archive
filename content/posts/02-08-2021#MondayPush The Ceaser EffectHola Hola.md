02-08-2021#MondayPush: The Ceaser EffectHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on something that I'm watching play out in the #twitterverse with a friend.Sad to see. Kind of feel like we're repeating the 2016-17 period again.So what's this have to do with the title. If you don't know anything about how a #ceaser came to power, allow me to summarize it as political mobility through backstabbing. I think that's where the phrase comes from too.Now in the case of this friend, it isn't about political office. But she is feeling acting by her own gender and crypto community members. And it is visual having a effect on here.But what does that means to you #ThinkersnDoers out there? Well, a simple and sad fact in going down the path of a entrepreneur is your more likely to experience the #CeaserEffect.The take away, I know it's easier said than done, but don't let it stop you from going forward. I'm sympathetic for those going through their woes now. As my son's grad-father use to say "this too shall pass..."#trekkw2ks #cryptocommunity #PoverB #cyberbullying&nbsp;
