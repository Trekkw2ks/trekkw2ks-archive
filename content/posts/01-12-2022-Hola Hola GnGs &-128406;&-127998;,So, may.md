1.12.2022Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,So, maybe a hour ago, I heard about this on #theGentlemanofCrypto YT channel. They do daily live streams about crypto news.Seems the former Twitter  #ceo, #JackDorsey has been busy.Contrary to the way CoinDesk is downplaying this as a proposal to make a #defensefund for Bitcoin devs. According to some other articles and another source in the space this is already in operation.The irony is the first case is a law suite.&nbsp;Go figure &#129318;&#127998;&zwj;♂️.&nbsp;Not sure on against who yet, but time will tell.So, who else is excited &#128588;&#127998;&#128588;&#127998;&#128588;&#127998; to see what the rest of 2022 has in store for the space?Tamra Groff Bettinna &#128050; Ryan Cooper  Amber D.
