3.07.2022Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Not sure why, but I woke up with #JayZ's lyric in my head from "Heart of the City" :&nbsp;"Now everyday I wake up, somebody got something to sayWhat's all the fkg fussing for?"Classic #hiphop, but nonetheless, it's Monday and the &#127757; is still here with all the good, bad, and ugly things and people roaming around on it.&nbsp;So, that Jay line got me thinking about being in the "trenches". Remember #theCarnival&#127904; connects what it does &#129335;&#127998;&zwj;♂️.&nbsp; And of course it's about what's happening in the #blockchain and #crypto space. But what else is new, lol.I've been saying for some time #MassAdoption isn't going to be the Wizard of Oz's yellow brick road. But instead a cobblestone road that will have some shyt on it. Now, I don't say this to be doom and gloomy guy. I do believe adoption of the technology will happen. I just don't see it being the #utopia some folks are trying to sell.And since I found a new feature in the app #inShot, I felt like sharing a visual to convey the thought.&nbsp;Agree or disagree, as always the DMs are open. And so are the comments for that matter.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersandDoers #History #Ukraine #Web3&nbsp;link
