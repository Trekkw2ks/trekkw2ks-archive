6-00-2020Thursday Blackness: The 10K ProjectHola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's raisedfist and hattip goes to The10KProject. The reason this has my attention is two fold.1. It was founded by some of members from @bbc. They get blockchain technology and understand that blackentrepreneurs receive the smallest amount of VC &#128176;compared to any other group.2. Using the CARES ACT,&nbsp; its geared towards providing black non accreditedinvestors the chance to be investors. In turn widening the door for black folks to have access (financial, network, and support services).In full discloser, I'm a member. This IS NOT a paid promo/endorsemen.&nbsp; To be clear, I'm not telling anyone to join like I did. Do your own due diligence research. If you understand selfdetermination. Then this should make some sense.&nbsp;hhimtrekk thursdayblackness creators innovators influencers investor realtalk VC blackdollar crowdfunding caresact blackpower blacksinblockchain blackspending blackownedbusinesses&nbsp;
