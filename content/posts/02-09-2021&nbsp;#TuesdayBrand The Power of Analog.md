02-09-2021&nbsp;#TuesdayBrand: The Power of Analogies.Hola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on a new books I'm listening to. It's Shortcuts: How Analogies Reveal Connection, Spark Innovation, And Sell Our Greatest Ideaby John Pollack.In search of finding what makes a good copy and creates better narrative for a brand, I've been search through Amazon for a few months.&nbsp;While working on my ebook #BrandEcho: Every Brand Has A Vocie, Who's Echoing Yours. I was running into some issues around the checklist practices of "best common practices" to build a brand.&nbsp;Conveying the value proposition of a product or service is a keystone of branding, IMO.My initial issue was trying to understand what works in a post#covid world?&nbsp;Since listening to the books, I have a better appreciation to how my company tagline and book title work as an analogy.I make more sense in the vlog, lol.#Trekkw2Ks #storyteller #connectingtheabstract #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB
