10-22-2019Tuesday Brand: Be YouHola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;This post is based on a J Morrison vid I saw the other day.&nbsp;Two dudes trying to sell CDs approched him while he was out shopping in a mall. They have a little verbal debate which works out in the end.&nbsp;During the back and forth, one of the guys say "who's you?Everybody big on social media..."This had me thinking about word I hear thrown around alot these day, authenticity. Actually this reminds me of 90's hiphop.Weird how we got to techi69.Anywho the vids makes more sense of this and personalbranding.Podcast:Trekken Cryptos 2 Connect&nbsp;Anchor.fm/trekk^# # # # # # # #&nbsp; # #&nbsp;
