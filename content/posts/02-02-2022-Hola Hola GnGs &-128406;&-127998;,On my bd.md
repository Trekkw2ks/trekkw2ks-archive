2.2.2022Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,On my bday I was talking with my old man about an epiphany I had about life.You can make a choice that in the moments looks &#128175;% good with no down side. The caveat is how you understand it and things at that stage of life. Because, the true effects of that choice can take 7 months to 10 years to play out.The real funky part is, you don't know know how any choice will play out down the road.He gave a lil chuckle (not the lol at you type) and said yep and you only get one shot, no do overs.Nothing to do with crypto news but it does make me think about the first choice I made to get involved with crypto. And years later I made another choice to make a living in the space.&nbsp;Come to think of it. I'm reminded of a speech Steve Jobs gave about connecting the dots in life. His point was since we don't know our future and the experiences we'll have. So, we can't connect the dots ahead of time. We can only look at our choices after the fact to connect them.I guess I'm connecting some of the dots today.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersandDoers #P0verB #life&nbsp;link&nbsp;
