02-01-2021#MondayPush:Believe It Or Don'tHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,So today's vlog is a combo of things. I was watching anime while drinking wine. Yes, I was being sophisticated and a geek at the same time, lol.&nbsp;I started watching @pixars #Soul too, but feel asleep. I swear it was only 1 bottle of wine. Don't judge me.So where's this going? Well I was trying to figure out what to talk about today. The takeaway is this, it's socially acceptable to fail one or more times at being an entrepreneur in the tech space. But in general it's frowned upon. I can look back now admit and better understand why I failed in fashion.The point. It's a new day, a new month, a new year, and a new decade. #YouGotThis... #Failforward&nbsp;&nbsp;#Trekkw2ks #fckblckhistorymonth#BelieveOrDont #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB
