02-23-2021I'm not sure what it is about Mondays but that seems to be the quietest day for cryptotwitter verse, as pointed out by&nbsp;Dominic Williams&nbsp;(@dominic_w). I tend to agree.&nbsp;Ironically, after responding to Dominic's post with a Trump GIF, I saw the following tweet by&nbsp;Alex Mashinsky (@Mashinsky) the founder of Celsius. Most people will miss this but it is worth paying attention to. It was a sophisticated shotsfired with an Obama style micdrop. When reading it, I LOLd while searching for the appropriate GIF to retweet.Alex basically called out another #3rdPartyWallet for liquidating ETH backed loans on their platform, claiming their was a price drop. BTW, it was @Neo that did that. Feel sorry for those folks.With the WallStDaddys doing as they please and main st folks searching for their come up. I see the market for #3PW crypto backed loan on the rise. Imagine some banks will be on the chopping block this decade.I have to say hats of to how you've built your BrnadEcho sir.Also, in full disclosure, I do have my pinky toe in some action on Celsius.&nbsp;https://twitter.com/Mashinsky/status/1363993714822180873
