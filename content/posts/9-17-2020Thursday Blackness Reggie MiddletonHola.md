9-17-2020Thursday Blackness: Reggie MiddletonHola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's raisedfist, hattip, and salute goes to Reggie Moore of Veritasium.I remember learning of Reggie from watching Max Kiaser. Back in the first decade of crypto, Reggie was pretty much the only black person publicly promoting&nbsp; a product.If you're not aware veritasium is&nbsp; built on the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp; So, yes, it means there are smart contracts and a token. I'll leave the link for the company in the first comment.And I liked to say thank you sir for being one of the first black faces in the space and changing the narrative.hiimtrekk ThursdayBlackness blacksintech goldandsilver smartcontract ethereum #2020aintready PoverB notjustconsumers blacksinblockchain ThinkersnDoers&nbsp;
