The event confirmed some things I've been saying for a while now. In case you aren't aware Billy is the author of "Woke Don't Mean Broke." And Dawn is the CEO of Popcom.The two covered a number of topics ranging from metaphysics to raising capitol for your startup.Some things I knew and some things, I had no awareness of. One thing they kept going back to is having to work on themselves mind, body, and spirit. This goes to what I've been experiencing as a new entrepreneur.&nbsp; And as I've said, building up to improve your self is a process.I explain more in the vlog.#Trekkw2ks #PoverB #ThinkersnDoers #selfehaling&nbsp;
