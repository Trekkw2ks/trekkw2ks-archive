07-05-2021#MondayPush: The Petri Dish Of LifeHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;&#129470;,Today's vlog is based on a Twitter post I did over the weekend. that's was based on a &#128173; escaping #thecarnival called my mind. In short I called human amoebas. Yes, that's the correct spelling. I googlied it.I won't call this a epiphany to life or anything. And to be honest, this post could've been a #WednesdayRant. But nonetheless, this is I came up with.The point is we're all humans and like amoebas striving to move from point A to B. We all work to move from obscurity to a position of acknowledgement. Also known as leaving a legacy.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #SgtTrekk
