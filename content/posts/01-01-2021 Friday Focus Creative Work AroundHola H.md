01-01-2021 #FridayFocus: Creative Work AroundHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today is the first day of the new year and it falls on a #FridayFocus. So that means I can start running my new intros. They'll all be&nbsp;#GIFs.&nbsp;&nbsp;While everyone one is still zigging, I'll be zagging in 2021.Now on to the point of this vlog, I believe 2021 will present us with a number of opportunities that we feel didn't happen in 2020. and trust I understand the feeling.&nbsp; But as I explained to my kids you didn't reach the goal because of covid per-say. It was more about figuring out the #workaround.Those convos connected me to what @nicolle had posted about hurrdle runner not stopping. I get more into it in the vlog.The point is 2021 is about creative workarounds. I hope your ready.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #StayFocused
