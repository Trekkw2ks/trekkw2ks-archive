02-25-2021#ThursdayBlackness: Thomas EnechiHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's &#128079;&#127998;s and ✊&#127998; goes to #ThomasEnechi of the @Bantu foundation.I've mentioned it a number of times that the people I acknowledge on these vlogs are largely based on the list created by @Deadri. So sometimes what I show on the list isn't what they are working on now.But in the case of Thomas he's added to his list of job title. As you see in his profile, he started with @ICO Bench, then got into @KuBitX, and added the @Bantu founfd. Nigeria is lucky to have someone like him in there backyard putting in the work at the ground level.From across the sea, let me say thank you sir for proving that wrong are more than consumers. Your works shows that we are influencers, innovators, and creators.I hope one day we can talk and I can learn from your experience in the space.#trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #Checkin #BlockchainNigeria #BlockchainAfrica
