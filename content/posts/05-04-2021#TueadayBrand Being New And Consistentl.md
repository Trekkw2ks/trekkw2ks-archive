05-04-2021#TueadayBrand: Being New And Consistently RepetitiveHola Hola GnGs &#129331;&#127998;,Today's vlog is an addition to last week's Tuesday Brand about integrating automation for content distribution. I just wanted to share some of how I get it to work for me. As I've mentioned I use @socialPilot @FTTT. I get out more content for my campaigns with less manually posting time. It's like the commercial you see everyday. Come to think of it, I spend no where near the funds of people I know with hundred and thousand dollars plus marketing budget. And my exposure is steadily climbing, at a fraction of the cost.&nbsp;So to not be a total bot I add in free thought posts. Sometimes they are repost or a random thought like I mentioned in the vlog.&nbsp;The takeaway, automation helps greatly when combined with original posts.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #automationhelps
