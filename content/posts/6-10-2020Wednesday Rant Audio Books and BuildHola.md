6-10-2020Wednesday Rant: Audio Books and BuildHola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's #vlog is a promised subject from last weekhat, #audiobooks. I breakdown why I like them and how they can be helpful to you with time management.&nbsp;The four #apps I use are libby, audible, librivox, n youttube (yes youtube, lol.) Yes. there are other apps and definitely ones cheaper than Amazon's version but these are my tools for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will admit, I do like the look of a stacked bookcase and the feel of paper pages. But the priority is acquiring knowledge while balancing them.&nbsp; And yes I listen to a books more than once.Last thoughts, congrats to the new folks graduating out of the @cryptochick hatchary.&nbsp;#hhimtrekk #Wednesdayrant #timemanagement #apphack #selfdevelopment #reading #audiobooksandbuild #freeinfo #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #2020aintready #expandyourmind #books #voiceover
