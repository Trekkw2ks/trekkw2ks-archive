03-24-2021#WednesdayRant: I Don't KnowHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,So today's vlog is largely based on a family experience in the "sunshine" &#128529;.&nbsp; Oh and something I've noticed while supporting this covid vaccination in MD.I don't know if @uber or lyft will be around by the time I'm 65. But what ever #driverless platform there is, I'll be using is.Now, to the point of this post. While dealing with some stuff for my mom, I had the chance to see my grandma. She turns 86 this week. It's mind blowing to think about how much history she's seen and made.This trip made me wonder about the #legacyblueprint I'm building for the line. And and how I'm setting things up for my self.&nbsp;Simply put, am I doing the right thing?Honest answer...I don't know.#Trekkw2Ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #Family #TheLegacy
