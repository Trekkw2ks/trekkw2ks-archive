2.22.2022Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,I've often told people, I'm a introvert with extrovertive tendencies. So, far all the out and about you see of my via social media. There are a number of days in-between where I'm just home exploring #theCarnival&#127904;.That being said, when I'm out, I'm out. If the event or a person at the event interest me. Then the city, state, or country doesn't matter. Eight times out of ten, I can work out the details to get there. I may not fly business class like @samson, but I get there.#EthDenver was just that. There were specific people I went to see. And thankfully, we had our time to talk. No #wristban needed, lol. Investing in people starts with talking to people.The picture below is of the Art hotel. And that's where I sat for a few hours running into people I knew but weren't expecting to see there. And who were definitely not expecting to see me there, sitting on a corner.The point is you don't have to be&nbsp; in side to talk with people.#Trekkw2ks #P0veB #Networking #CommunityBuilding #WillTravelToTalk #InvestInPeople
