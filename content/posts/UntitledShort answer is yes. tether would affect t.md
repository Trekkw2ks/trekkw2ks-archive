UntitledShort answer is yes. tether would affect the temporary price of Bitcoin if it dropped.But you're forgetting to mention that there are other stablecoins. Also you're not distinguishing between CEXs and DEXs. No one calls them "gray markets" but people who are traditional (anolog) economist thinking. Stop talking like a Boomer, lol.and you do not need kyc in order to use any cryptocurrency. that is not a native function of the technology. you can use tether without using centralized exchanges like coinbase. Your missing the point of how the tech actually works.Most people use tether as dry powder. It's not a long-term store of value. it is used as a trading and conversion tool. You can do atomic swaps or in-app conversions which don't require kyc.also the argument that you bring out about tether doing gamification or fractional lending is not new news this it has been said for years.last point the article talking about receiving tether for doing certain tasks. those are called bounties. that is nothing new in the space other projects have been doing the same thing for years. That is a growth hack method for gaining traction of your project/coin/tokenStill love your videos keep them coming.
