06-08-2021#TuesdayBrand: I Didn't Think Of ThisHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;&#128483;️,So today's is vlog is about @fiverr. Yes, most of us in the entrepreneurship world know about. Well, at least here in the states it a thing. I know other regions can have their version of it.Anywho, I had a "business meeting" over #spanishfood last week. I forget the name of the spot in Baltimore. But who turns down fish tacos and plantains. Not this friend, who only came for free plantains (I paid).But I digress, the point is I know I said "I'm not doing #paidads." In my defense, I was thinking of directly using Facebook, Twitter, n Instagram. It never thought about using them indirectly. This isn't the same thing as #influencermarketing, now that I think about it.Nonetheless, I did learn some things from the process. And I talk about them in the vlog.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #SgtTrekk #LifeAfterAIT
