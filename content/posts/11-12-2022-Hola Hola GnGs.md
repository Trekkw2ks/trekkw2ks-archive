11.12.22Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Recently the opportunity came up to play #BeachBum for a day aka camp at the Assateague National park down passed #OceanCity.The TDLR version is I came, I saw, and the ⛱️ won.Who knew &#129335;&#127998;&zwj;♂️ you could go to the beach and almost get killed with out putting even you pinky toe int the &#127754;. Well that was a experience and listen learned &#129318;&#127998;&zwj;♂️.Takeaways:1. The 11/11 full moon was beautiful to watch and a great setting to ponder about my influence in the space.2. It's really crazy how much city lights take away from the ✨ in a clear night sky.3. I'm not a crypto bro or crypto rich by any means. But I live one of the most uncommon lifestyles for people I know in and outside the space.4. Wet sand is a slow cold death.Well, thanks the end of that. So until my next random post about who knows what have a #PoverB day folks.P.S. Yes, I'm still creating in the space. Expanded the content and working on a second #MetaverseHackathon where you win #btc for actually hacking in a metaverse.#Trekkw2ks #WereNotTourists #ThinkersnDoers #beachlife #ImAlive #BuildRDAO
