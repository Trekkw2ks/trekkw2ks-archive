09-17-2021#FridayFocus: Talking from a umbrella ☔Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is brought to you by #mothernature and me being determined to make my step count today.For most folks setting a goal and executing the steps to accomplish it is easy enough to do. What screws most of us up from finishing the objective is when obstacles start popping up.&nbsp;Case in point, this weather vs my wanting to have better health long term. Not&nbsp; to mention getting BTC (⛪ lol) while doing it (the DM office is open if your curious how.)The take away is find your umbrella.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB&nbsp;
