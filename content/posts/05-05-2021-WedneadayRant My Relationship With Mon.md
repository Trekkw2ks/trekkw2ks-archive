05-05-2021#WedneadayRant: My Relationship With MoneyHola Hola &#128406;&#127998;&#128483;️,Happy #CincoDeMayo&#127882;&#127881;!!!Today's post is based on something I've been pondering&nbsp;since 2019. I can't remember who was the first person I heard bring up #moneyrelationahips. But the trigger for this vlog was a conversation between Christ Do and Blair inns.I've heard multiple entrepreneur like Dawn Dickerson, Tavonia Evans and #RedPill talk about unlearning the negative ways we relate to &#128176;. But until making the post I didn't connect some of the things I learned.I breakdown some of my epphifanies in the video.The point, we all have been learned positive and negative&nbsp; to relate to money. As a entrepreneur, your goin to have to unlearn some of the things to balance your self and grow your business.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #TagnShare&nbsp;
