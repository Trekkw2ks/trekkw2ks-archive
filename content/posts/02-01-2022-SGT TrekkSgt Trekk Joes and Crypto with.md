2.01.2022 SGT TrekkSgt Trekk: Joes and Crypto without the AR BullshitHola Hola &#128406;&#127998;,Welcome to SGT Trekk, this is Joe's and Crypto Without the AR Bullshit. I hope to give some practical advice that will be able to help anyone who has or is wearing the uniform, from the private to the four-star general.&nbsp;&nbsp;First I should say though this is not financial advice or telling you what you should do in this thing called the blockchain crypto space. It is just me sharing my experiences and observations of the space that I could see as being beneficial to people in the service.&nbsp;&nbsp;So to start off and just like a overview of what the book will be about it's covering some of the basics from the security aspect to the basics of wallets as well as to the different parts of the community that you can be involved in whether it be mining or trading or looking at nfts or understanding more about this metaverse stuff as well as things that you should be aware of as for how it relates to you know being in uniform and dealing with things like taxes not offering tax advice as to what you should do just saying things that you should be aware of. and so the other thing too that I want to bring to your attention is there a ways that you can legally legitimately earn crypto for what you do while in and out of uniform and that is like kind of what I really wanted to bring home as they say land a plane for those of you who are also in the uniform like myself and I'll get further into that into the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;So let me first say that I'm not going to say I am an expert in everything that is crypto or blockchain related granted I have been in the space for a number of years at this point at the time of writing this book in looking at when I got like my first crypto to now being 2022 wow that's like almost 10 years now yeah yeah like almost 10 years now not like a full 10 but almost 10 nonetheless my point is that I have gone through I want to say all of the ups and downs that you can pretty much go through in this space so that is spending crypto that is hoddling crypto which is also called investing nowadays it wasn't called that when I first got in as well as you know doing the whole peer-to-peer aspect of crypto which was what the original intention was about for those of us who go back that far try to do mining try to do trading I've lost crypto I have worked to earn crypto I've been gifted crypto I've gifted crypto I've done all of the like early stuff that you could do within the beginning parts of crypto.&nbsp;My point to say to this is I look at the space as a growing teenager at this point where you have the first half decade there was a lot of wild wild west stuff that was a lot of the the technology was clunky the information wasn't really out there like that the ethos and the mantras and all that stuff was a very different thing than what is going on now in the second half of the decade with Bitcoin being officially like 13 years old now as a technology that has been in use across the globe for 13 years now. The the thing now that gets it is that the idea of what you can use the technology for how you should use it or why should you be aware or involved is a real simple thing in that the technology and its applications and use cases are so vast that there's no real way to get around it not being in part of your life especially for what is happening in technology in the Western countries as well as in second and third to our countries for how we're looking at money for how we're looking at digital identity for how we're looking at things like documentation and and legal frameworks and jurisdictions and digital identity on the technology side blockchain technology which is the base of cryptocurrencies as it is known now is the base technology for this one use case but there are other use cases for the technology the other thing to note is that blockchain technology as a technology which is basically a form of data storage has been around since like the seventies I think and. Not to get into the Weeds on like the technicals of when this technology versus that part of the technology came into but understand in short there was a very big crossing of the chasm moment in what Satoshi nakamoto did with solving a very critical thing called the Byzantine the general's fault and so that made the money use case a a very real practical thing.&nbsp;All right so the critical part of what I want to address like the book is x amount focused on the technology but not in a way of just totally and solely talking about the financial aspects of it. However I won't go into the Weeds on the technical aspects of blockchain technology and then like the different things of consensus and consensus mechanisms or things like utxo and like the accounting formats and stuff like that only because that would be a lot bigger of a book because they're not necessarily one paragraph talking points there's a lot more that goes into it especially in explaining how these things interact and have evolved from the first decade into the second decade and what we see going on in the space right now. And so I will touch a little bit on the tech side of it but this is more so about talking or or explaining out the financial use cases or the monetary use cases of what's going on in the space and giving some level of the other industries that are being built out on this technology that is called blockchain technology and so we'll go from there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay so the first thing to start from I guess is to put it in perspective of blocking technology is not a new new technology I'm not looking to go into the technical like computer engineering level conversations or computer science conversations on the technology but the the base thing that you need to know is that like as a method of data storage that has a security element to it that is based on cryptography blockchain technology is not a new new thing it's been around for a couple of decades going back towards the 80s 70s and so what makes this moment right now more critical about blockchain technology is that a gentleman or a person or a group of people no one actually knows knows by the name of Satoshi nakamoto was able to figure out this thing called the Byzantine general's fault and so that was able to deal with something of where you reduce the trust that you needed in order to have a transaction happen between two parties and and what does basically means when we say reduce trust is like you can basically automate this in this mathematical you know techie program cuz at the end of the day blockchain is really just a code and how somebody figured out how to make something transactional without having like more people involved in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we're able with using blockchain technology and being able to have transactions happen between or two or three people without them actually knowing each other we get into this thing called having a trustless transaction now for the more old school has the more privacy had focused the more technique the techie folks we understand it it is not actually trustless but is more so trust reduced but that is not the point of this chapter or the book to get into the Weeds on stuff like that the point is simply this someone figured out how to make the code work to be able to do transactions without having a 100% human trust in another human being that's the bottom line of it and it's a a new a more effective way of also involving cryptography.&nbsp;What's Blockchain?&nbsp;So now blockchain is a technology has a series of use cases that the first thing that came into play was cryptocurrencies which is based on cryptography which is a way of hashing and concealing information in a techie manner right and again not getting into the technical Weeds on how cryptography works but I will say that part of the thing that made cryptography become a more public tool set is that the cypherpunk movement those early pioneer folks believe that the ability for the everyday person to have this tool of using cryptography was something that everyone should have and there's a whole thing in relation to like the the movement and what their ideals were back then and how x amount of people carried over to now I will say this when you talk to a lot of the newer people who are in the space those ideas and that value system do not connect to how they see the technology or how they look to use it now but it doesn't mean it's the end of the world if you don't get that that's not what inhibits or allows you to be able to use the technology if you agree with the ethos or any of that stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;and so cryptocurrency ends up being the first let's say practical use case of blockchain technology and it was the easiest thing to get everyone's attention on right hey there's a new type of money thing it's an internet money thing and we had all these different narratives well in the beginning the major narrative was it's this new internet money and the government doesn't control it and you could you know do what you want with it and it was untraceable and what was the other thing it was anonymous. again for the techie folks who understood how it worked at the coder level and understood how to look at things like blockchain explorers and all that stuff they knew that it was pseudonymous and that the marketing narrative of cryptocurrencies as being anonymous was not what the case was. And over time a lot of people learn the hard way that Bitcoin was not anonymous it was synonymous and they learned it what the difference was when certain law enforcement people came knocking on doors with nice shiny bracelets so. So now let's jump forward right Bitcoin ends up being the first known well Bitcoin is not the first cryptocurrency but it is the first cryptocurrency that has a actual public name outside of the more techy folks cool you know that was a small group of people who actually like the geeks and nerds who understood how to use the machines to make the early versions of a digital currency and there were other ones before Bitcoin but Bitcoin has the first let's say public acknowledgment of oh you don't have to be the techie-teki type person to understand how to use this thing granted in the beginning you didn't need to have a little bit more technical inclination in order to be able to use it but it has gotten way easier over the years for Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies and tokens that are out right now in regards to Wallace and exchanges and all that type of stuff. SoSo Bitcoin comes on the scene not too long after that ethereum comes on the scene and granted I'm not going to get into the name of like all of the smaller coins and everything in between but I do want y'all to understand that when the Bitcoin ethereum thing happens this is where we have a break that comes into you have tokens and you have coins the early coins are like the the what do they call them legacy legacy coins is Bitcoin ethereum Litecoin and there's another one that I cannot think of at the moment blank blank blank blank blank. And so the difference between a coin and a token is that a coin can have a token on its blockchain so a Bitcoin sorry a cryptocurrency blockchain can have a token created on the blockchain and the thing that brings this into play is when you start involving smart contracts which is what allows you to form these things called tokens but a token cannot equal or cannot have a coin on its Network just one of the ways it works and so you have aetherium which then gets into the lead or is how to say this it grandfather not grandfather's it pioneers the direction of making the the token movement in the in the crypto space and so now to date I think there's over like 2000 or 20 what maybe 3,000 different tokens that are out there now and so depending on you know what you're trying to do each one of these tokens kind of have different use cases and who's trying to say that their token does something better than the other token the same thing happens with the coins so you have things like dogecoin you have stuff like decred you have oh man there are so many coins. New paragraph new paragraph So what really is the point of what you really need to understand in this part is that there are different coins and different tokens and for the way things have gone over you know these last couple of years there is no like right or wrong way to get into crypto per se there are definitely things that have higher and lower risk though case in point if you I heard a coin or a token that was mentioned on you know the news and it said oh this thing is going to pump and then you just go off and spend $3,000 on it because you heard of it on the news and when you ask your other friends who actually have been in the space for a bit and they're like I never heard of that before chances are you might have just jumped into a pump and dump and you're about to lose you $3,000 and the chances are really high as opposed to if you actually did your research to say okay is this a real token is it on an exchange does it have a community behind it are they actually working to make something do I understand what it is that they're doing you answer you ask and answer some of those questions and that'll be the kind of self litmus test in doing your own due diligence on whether is this something that if I put $3,000 in I'm okay with losing like that is like always the base question even if you don't understand none of what this techy stuff is if you're going to put your energy and effort in terms of time and money into something you have to ask yourself the question of can I afford to lose what I put in this and how long is my quote time horizon for getting some kind of like return on this thing where it makes sense.What's Bitcoin?Technically speaking bitcoin isnt the first "magic internet money". But it did solve a issue that no one before it could. I'm not gonna get deep in the weeds about this. But the basic issue was how do you stop people from double spending the digital money? This is called the bezyntens general problem. And until Satoshi Nakamoto it was seen as the glass ceiling to unlocking the full potential of digital money.The simplist thing to say is Bitcoin is a technology that allows you to transfer value between people. It doesn't matter wear you are in the world. You can do it with a radio signal, smart phone, dummy phone, satellite, QR code, and piece of paper. Yes even with paper.Now, I strongly recommend at some point you take the time out and read the Bitcoin White paper. I know most of you won't. But for those who do, it help you understand why the technology behind what makes cryptocurrency work.When it comes to crypto, I'm Andresaian (this is in reference to one of the first people I learned about blockchain and cryptos Andreas Antonoplous. The basic idea that you cant tell people what or how they should use crypto. In The early days one of the core principles was thatWhat's are scamsWhat's is a crypto wallet? So here she funny thing about crypto wallets. First off, they aren't actually wallets. even this we call them wallets they don't actually hold any crypto in them. They are closer more to a key chain. The phrase "not your keys, not your crypto.", Comes from out wallet technically work. But ill get to that in a minute.First, let's me breakdown the different types of wallets. There are self custody, 3rd party, multi-sign, hot wallet, cold storage, and deep freeze. And depending on what your doing in the space you make need to have one or more of them.Let start with custodial wallets. They are usually associated with centralized exchanges, commonly called CEX. Examples of a CEX would be Coinbase, FTX, and Binance.&nbsp; At the time of writing this book, Custodial wallets are also becoming more common among the NFT and digital assets platforms. I'll save the can of worms for later in the book. So what's so special about these wallets? Imo, not much. Custodial wallets are actually owned by the website or app that your using. And as owners/controllers (depends on who's ToS you read) of the wallet they can stop, reverse, cancel, or suspend transactions. It's like you getting a kiddy account with parental controls on.So how do they do this you ask. Well remember the key thing. In crypto wallets there are two types of keys. One is the public key. That's the one that everyone one see when sending you crypto. But there's another more important key. That's the private key. And that's the one you use to sign transactions. The private key is the power house of the wallet.What is DeFi?DeFi stands for Decentralized finance.&nbsp;What are best security practices?What's is yield farming?What's are NFTs?What's play to earn?How do I make money?What about uncle Sam?List of resources?
