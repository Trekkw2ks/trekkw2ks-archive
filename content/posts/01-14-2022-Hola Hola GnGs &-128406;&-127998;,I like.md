1.14.2022Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,I like to make correction for a something I said on the Creation Process Part 2 post for #PokeTheBear.Here's the linke for what original post. link.So, I made the mistake of describing our use of #tinyurls on the backend as a uncensorable technology. And as my collab partner #Doug3D pointed out after my post, they definitely are not.However, they do help with shorting the URLs where using for #WayBackMachine and the market place links, which can be quit long sometimes.I figured to give some transparency to admitting my mistake, I'd make a new post about it instead of editing original the post like nothing happened.For those who still don't get NFTs or care about #web3 and real decentralized technologies. It's ok. Have a #P0verB day.#Trekkw2ks #Iwaswrong #FTX #CustodialLs #accountability #DesruptiveTech #Coinbase #Binance #Tezos #Wax #OpenSea
