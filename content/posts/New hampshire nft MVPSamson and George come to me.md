New hampshire nft MVPSamson and George come to me with an idea for ghost minting constellations for the University of Michigan I believe or New Hampshire I don't remember which university is.It immediately makes me think of what crypto bully was talking about with super world where you can buy the geographical grid in the AR world around real world spaces so. New paragraph. Is if I wrote working to mint this collection of constellations for them in the meantime I can buy the unstoppable domains and I can buy up the virtual David know the AR real estate around the campus andThe idea is when they want to figure out what to do with the AR side of things they would have to then come back to me as checks Mark and salting in order to be able to utilize that AR space around the campus.So the basic idea on this first MVP is to create a nft that will be used as a fundraiser sue for the observatory of the University feria de paragraph one idea I have is to have the website for the people who are not crypto aware or techie they would have the website where they can pick the item out and they would be able to buy it in USD they're going to pay a premium then these are.Then you have the people who are crypto a where they can buy it in wax or aetherium.I also was thinking about doing like some variations that you have like the baseline here's just a picture of the constellations and then have like you no bells and whistles version where you have the one that does like a twinkle sparkle thing then you have one that has like a twinkle sparkle and glisan and plus it has music on it and I can say something in there like I was here you know that's another example.The other thing that I was thinking was to then have the people who purchase it it has a utility for them so if you purchase just the if if there are like some kind of season passes or something that goes to the observatory you now get like at least one year of free visitation to the observatory.If you purchase the like thousand-dollar nft.You get the you got the.okay if you purchase a higher-priced rarity one it will entitle you to get more stuff so the idea is not only is this a fundraiser for particular thing but it would then also work to give you some level of access to something or some level of acknowledgement that will come then go forward in the AR world are within the real world and I think that if we did it on the level of the community around the observatory like having a $10 version and if you collected all 10 pieces of a constellation get Dan allowed you to be able to get a one-month viewing or something along that line at the University or at the The observatory.So the basic flow of this should be there is a website you go to the website that allows you to purchase and USD the thing that you want to pick if you paying USD there is a premium price point for it if you are cryptor where you can and then go forward to wax the iOS you can purchase it using wax or etherium and you might get some other kind of benefit that the people who did the USD don't get second thought on that one.Are you call so the idea of doing the super super world around the campus and then have augmented are your old mentor reality layouts are something within the building itself and then have stuff for the campus that actually like says you know who this person is I'm thinking about like how do you put in other utilities that makes sense for the price point and then also trying to get people to understand like being able to push this going forward of hey if you want to have this in your family and its universities here for like another 50 a hundred years like if y'all been here for two hundred years guess what this would be something you would have passed out like old my grandfather was the one who did the endowment for blah blah blah blah blah.Then I think that we could do a lower price point that would allow for other members of the community around the university to also take ownership or not ownership like they own it control it but have some level of like yeah we actually like did something to help this so like I think we could argue of this particular project for something that is going to be presented within the observatory and then like all of the like let's say 100 or 300 students who were there for the class of blah blah blah they get to have their names in the a r space that is you know digitally connected to that particular project and all they had to do was just pay $5 right and we just make like a thousand of those and see you make a hundred first see how it works out and then if it does push it onto a thousand oh I'm and you do keep it going from there and the other part that I thought about.Is that I can create the website for the school and sue me use the use the the royalties to go back to the school and that way it would be something that would be continually funding the the school as far as that particular project or thing and you know who's like connected to that or who has that that right of ownership to say like I helped build that I helped fund that so bottom line is we could use the nfc's as a new crowdfunding method for the observatory for the school basically bottom-line like and I can also put it in where it would be a a new it allows the student body to be a process.
