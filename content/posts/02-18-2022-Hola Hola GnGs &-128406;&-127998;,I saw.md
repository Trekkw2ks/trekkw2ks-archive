02.18.2022Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,I saw this post last night on #twitter. And it's now making it round in some of the chat groups I'm in.The #Transparency of #blockchain is always used as a forefront talking point. Rarely do you hear about the transparency of founders and CEOs running some of the top companies in the space.The recent actions of the #Canadian government has set off a change of conversations. Most of those exchanges are taking place in #CryptoTwitter. Which is interesting when comparing it to what my #LinkedIn feed. I know it's suppose to be the place of professional talking business. But arguably, this is something that will effect the businesses of people in and out side of Canada. IMO, it will ripple out into the lives of regular people who were not connected to the #FreedomConvey.But any who, about the picture below. It's a response by #JessePowell (CEO of Kraken) to a question about law enforcement forcing them seize people crypto.Again, we talk about the transparency of blockchain. But what about the transparency of the people running the companies?Is this transparent enough?
