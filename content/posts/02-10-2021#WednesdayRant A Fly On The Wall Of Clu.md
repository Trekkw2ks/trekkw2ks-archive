02-10-2021#WednesdayRant: A Fly On The Wall Of ClubHouse.Hola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,So, I finally got on #ClubHouse. No I didn't buy a whole new &#127822; phone. Kind of a waste of money in my opinion. However, here I am with some observations of the app. I was trying to go less than 8 mins in the vlog but it didn't happen &#128541;.In the short, I agree with what @samson is saying about it being of no real monitary value for the end user in comparison to what @GoingPublic is about to do.&nbsp; I drinking the koolaid. But I recommend not following me on that, lol.&nbsp;Nonetheless, I do see CH impacting the #BrandEcho of companies and major personalities, assuming it's around for several years.I cover more observations in the vlog and make a possible prediction.&nbsp;#Trekkw2Ks #JustListen #PartyLine2.0 #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #FreeMakesYouTheProduct
