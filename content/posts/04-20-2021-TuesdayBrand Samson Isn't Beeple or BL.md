04-20-2021#TuesdayBrand: Samson Isn't Beeple or BLAUHola Hola GnGs &#128104;&#127998;&zwj;&#127912;,So, it turns out Samson is no great NFT artist. Well that's no surprise, but how did we find out?By testing the @OpenSea #openmarket of course.&nbsp;What am I talking about?So, the #pointyhairedguy made the content. I minted it and set it as a biding sale. Didn't break the bank being a full Eth. But the set min bed was $300 and change.&nbsp;While there were some on lookers. No one actually bid.&nbsp;In the vlog I explain lessons learns and correcctions made going forward.#trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #GhostMinter #DigitalPresense
