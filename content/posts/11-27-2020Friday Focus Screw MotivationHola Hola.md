11-27-2020Friday Focus: Screw MotivationHola Hola GnGs,Today's #vlog is based on some events from this week that got me thinking. The tipping point of it all connecting for me was watching a Twitter post by @Vusi.If you've listened to the vlogs for a while I've mentioned him a few times. I explain what is clip in the video.So how does the title relate to you #ThinkersnDoers?&nbsp;Simple...Motivation is cool for the story, but the truth is there is no magic bullet. In order to grow/scale/develop, you have to discipline yourself to the process.This book "situation" has taught me a few things. And as usual, I explain more in the video.#hhimtrekk #FridayFocus #100pages #fckmotivation #selfdiscipline #PoverB #2021IsAlmostHere #Trekkw2ks
