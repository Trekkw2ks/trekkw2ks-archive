04-14-2021#WednesdayRant: Technical Difficulties&nbsp;Hola Hola GnGs&#129318;&#127998;&zwj;♂️,Well today's vlog is about my micro SD card taking a crap on my the other day. And TBH, I didn't realize how much stuff I don't have access to until making the post.&nbsp;Now, as a person building a #BrandEcho based on content, is this a sizable issue?100%!!! But is it the end of the world? NoWhy? Because It doesn't stop me from making content. I can still make other new intros and clips. Plus I don't feel like getting work up at that of all things today.The point, shit happens when it comes to tech. Some things can be avoided but at the end of the day. Technology it breaks too.&nbsp;I wonder if anyone can tell me how to fix a corrupted #MicroSDCard? Doesn't hurt to ask.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB&nbsp;
