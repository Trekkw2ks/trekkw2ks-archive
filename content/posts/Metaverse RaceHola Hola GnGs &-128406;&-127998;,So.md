Metaverse RaceHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,So, I'm back from #Lisbon with so many thoughts to share based on my observations and conversations.I was able to talk with some really interesting folks and see the NEAR community up close in action. Will get into some of the projects in later posts.Now about the graphic. I'd love to explain. But that's a whole post unto itself. However, if your going to the #BlackBlockchainSummit at Howard University&nbsp; Sept 22 - 24, you can ask me why I think mainstream adoption of #metaverses are a race to the #bathroom, lol.Shout out to #Blk@ #BlkW3b and #NearFoundation for the opportunity to attend #NEARCon22. PS: I can't for get shout out to the #Airdrops and #cherryshots (you had to be there, &#128518;).Tamra Groff Samson Williams George Pullen Jaime Arroyave, Jr. Bianca J.
