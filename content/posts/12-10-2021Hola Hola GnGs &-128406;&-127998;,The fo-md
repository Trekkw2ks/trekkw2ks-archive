12.10.2021Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,The following is my DM to @Rasom of Crypto job list about working in the crypto space. The event was hosted on Twitter yesterday."So, I was late, but I did catch the talk.I was surprised no one brought up #PlayToEarn as a way to get into the space.If the goal is to get into the space and make money. It's seems like one of the easier ways in.Especially, if you're in a 2nd and 3rd tier economy.Thinking out the box.The benefits:1. In order to play, you do research on the game, the team behind it, the blockchain it works on, and the wallet it works with (edited).2. You learn about the&nbsp; #tokenomics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-added for post: How do you earn the reward? How do you on-off ramp to a spendable currency? Can you leverage the rewards, ie staking.3. You can build a network of people inside and outside the industry.4. You can get connected to the devs and founders and build rapport.5. You build a reputation that can be leverage for something else.&nbsp;6. You can get good enough to become a #betatester for games. So, you have access to potentially more lucrative items.7. You earn money by playing a game, lol. (edited)8. There is no discrimination based on age, gender, sex, race, language, or geography. Just have internet and willingness to learn.Any who, just a thought."Point 8 was not in the original DM.&nbsp;This post is really for the folks who think that you need a degree or have to code to be in the space. As I been saying for a number of years now. That's not true. There are various paths to being in the space with out learning code.Bruce Ann Keir Betty Phil tamra esports twin ryan#Trekkw2ks #CryptoGames #InvestInPeoplt #PoverBhttps://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6875116606054268928/
