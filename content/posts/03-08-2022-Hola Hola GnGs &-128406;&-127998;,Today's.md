3.08.2022Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's meme is created with inshot and inspired by a comment Carlos made on my post yesterday.Post link:He basically said when entering the space start off wide then filter down to what you can focus on.The visual takeaway for #theCarnival&#127904; is the meme you see below (made this morning while in &#128719;️, lol). Now, I've never went away to college (I did go though) but I have heard the stories about people going to their first college party and loosing their shyt.This is how I see newbs aping into the speculative part of the space. Grab (drink) every #Shitcoin, #NFT, #Metaverse #vapeware project they can find strictly off FOMO. Fck TA/FA, I heard it in a #TwitterSpaces or ClubHouse cause I can't afford joining a #AlphaGroup.More importantly, over time folks filter down to find their niche(s) (fav drink aka fav crypto project). In the end, most learned from getting #rekt #rugpulled, and getting exhausted from trying to flip and track 50 to 100 coins, it's not worth it because most of the stuff is &#128169;.Eventually, they become the #OG who drinks straight out the bottle with a pinky in the air because #experience made them a fancy #degen.#Trekkw2ks #CollegeLife #New #ThinkersandDoers #P0verB #crypto ##QualitativeObservation&nbsp;link
