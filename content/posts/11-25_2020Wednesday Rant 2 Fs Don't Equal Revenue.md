11-25_2020Wednesday Rant: 2 Fs Don't Equal RevenueHola Hola GnG,Today's #vlog is based on something that has kind of been on my mind for a about a week now. But a conversation I heard on #SocialProof podcast put it into perspective for me.The takeaway is that friends and family are not good ways to starts, grow, and maintain a business. This isn't to say they can't support you in other ways. Or it doesn't mean that can't financially support, e.i. buying your product or service at least once.Btw, that's the focus of this post, making the revenue needed to be a business. In the video, I get more into what I've noticed in my trek so far and why I changed.Has anyone else noticed this?#hhimtrekk #WednesdayRant #relationships #keepingfriends&nbsp;#ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #2021IsAlmostHere #Trekkw2ks&nbsp;
