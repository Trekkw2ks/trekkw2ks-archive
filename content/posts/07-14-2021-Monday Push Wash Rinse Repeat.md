07-14-2021#MondayPush: Wash, Rinse, RepeatHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;Today's vlog IMO is nothing exciting or really motivational. Spoiler alert, much like entrepreneurship, lol.While counting my steps around the track. I thought a timely reminder was due about the truth of being able to say "I'm a boss."&nbsp;If this is you're at first go like me, take note of the title.&nbsp;For all the excitement of being the one in charge. It's mostly a wash, rinse, and repeat process doing what it takes to sell your product or service directly or leading the people who make your business work. There is really no way of dressing it up like everyday is a new discovery.&nbsp;I feel that would be misleading to the day to day workings of scaling a #sidehustle to a business then growing it into a company.The takeaway, entrepreneurship is mostly boring shit.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #LifeAfterAIT #SgtTrekk
