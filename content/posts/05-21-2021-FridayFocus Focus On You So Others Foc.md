05-21-2021#FridayFocus: Focus On You So Others Focus On YouHola Hola GnGs ,Today's vlog is a jewel I picked up from the #RecessionProofConference put together by David Never Sleeps, host of the Social Proof Podcast. There were a number of jewels drop by his panelists&nbsp;Marcus Barney, Alix Burton, Jason Lobdell, Justin Owens,  and Nehemiah Davis, all members of #CircleofCEOs.&nbsp;If you don't know who they are, it's ok. There's this thing called the internet and it knows all. I didn't tag any of them because they don't use this platform. Nonetheless, the names are there for you to research.But I digress, back to the subcaption. The point is that when it comes to building a business and growing it through social media. You have to focus on first to gain the knowledge and skill set needed to be good at what you do. Showing that growth/process is impart what brings people to focus on you. There's a caveat or two to this, mainly don't be afraid to work with others. Tell that story.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #FocusOnYouDate posted 05-24-2021
