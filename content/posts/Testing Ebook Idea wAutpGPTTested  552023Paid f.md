Testing Ebook Idea w/AutpGPTTested : 5/52023Paid for OpenAI API Key ($20)Added HuggingFace APICouldn't get LinkedIn APIStuck at trying to scrap using BeautifulSoupChanged to "Smart LLM"Enabled "AI Settings" and "User Agent"Speak Mode:&nbsp; ENABLED NEWS:&nbsp; # Website and Documentation Site &#128240;&#128214; Check out *https://agpt.co*, the official news &amp; updates site for Auto-GPT! The documentation also has a place here, at *https://docs.agpt.co* # &#128640; v0.3.0 Release &#128640; Over a week and 275 pull requests have passed since v0.2.2, and we are happy to announce the release of v0.3.0! *From now on, we will be focusing on major improvements* rather than bugfixes, as we feel stability has reached a reasonable level. Most remaining issues relate to limitations in prompt generation and the memory system, which will be the focus of our efforts for the next release. Highlights and notable changes in this release: ## Plugin support &#128268; Auto-GPT now has support for plugins! With plugins, you can extend Auto-GPT's abilities, adding support for third-party services and more. See https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins for instructions and available plugins. ## Changes to Docker configuration &#128011; The workdir has been changed from */home/appuser* to */app*. Be sure to update any volume mounts accordingly! # ⚠️ Command `send_tweet` is DEPRECATED, and will be removed in v0.4.0 ⚠️ Twitter functionality (and more) is now covered by plugins, see [Plugin support &#128268;]Welcome back!&nbsp; Would you like me to return to being Entrepreneur-GPT?Continue with the last settings?Name:&nbsp; Entrepreneur-GPTRole:&nbsp; assistant to Trekkw2ks and helps develop and execute strategies to monitize his content.Goals: ['examine Trekkw2ks digital footprint', 'provide several ideas of how to profit already existing content', 'create a dynamic website using IPFS to showcase content ie vlogs, blogs, ebook', 'create book content based on twitter and linkedIn posts', 'create marketing campaign using Social pilot']Continue (y/n): nWelcome to Auto-GPT!&nbsp; run with '--help' for more information.Create an AI-Assistant:&nbsp; Enter the name of your AI and its role below.

This will give us a good starting point for categorizing the posts and identifying potential themes for the ebooks. We can then analyze the engagement of different post formats to identify the most effective format for the ebooks. Once we have this information, we can create outlines for the ebooks and present them to Trekkw2ks for feedback and approval.REASONING:&nbsp; Analyzing the posts will give us a good starting point for identifying themes and topics for the ebooks. Analyzing the engagement of different post formats will help us determine the most effective format for the ebooks.

Most remaining issues relate to limitations in prompt generation and the memory system, which will be the focus of our efforts for the next release. Highlights and notable changes in this release: ## Plugin support &#128268; Auto-GPT now has support for plugins! With plugins, you can extend Auto-GPT's abilities, adding support for third-party services and more.
