03-17-2021#WednesdayRant: All I Can Do Is ShareHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,So todays vlog is kinda a vent/ramble.For those who follow me, you've seen the content flow grow here on LinkedIn. I'm doing the same on my other platforms.A major focus for this year is the #giveaway I'm doing for @guapcoin. And a growing interest in sharing @samsons content on crowd funding and the space economy.And because of it I get questioned on what do I get out of it? The short answer is I share the info because im trying to give people options. It's a long run play for me.Doing this giveaway has been a interesting learning process. It reminds me of the saying of leading a horse to water.I get into to other realizations in the vlog.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkerdnDoers #PoverB #CantSaveThemAll #TryingToHelp
