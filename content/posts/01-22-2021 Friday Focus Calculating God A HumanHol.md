01-22-2021 #FridayFocus: Calculating God A HumanHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's post is generated by a book I recently finished listening to. I'm all about #AudioBooksandBuild. And since finishing that I started @keir book #MoveOverBrokeraHereComesBlockchain, but I digress.&nbsp;The book is called Calculating God by James. To be honest, I prob would've never found this book on my own. But I'm glad I heard about it on the Lex Freedman podcast (that's your guy @ben).It brings up a interesting about how humans interpret god. And it made me think about how we as entrepreneurs react to events in a positive or negative way.As usual I cover more in the vlog.#trekkw2ks&nbsp;#howyoureact #lifelesson #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #Checkin
