03-01-2021#MondayPush: Be GroundedHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on two live streams I took part in yesterday.I was one of the guest cohost on #CryptoBloodtv. Its a weekly gathering where we talk about some of the news happening in the blockchain/crypto space. Now that I think of it. We're basically like crypto pondents, lol.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second stream was on Cupcakes &amp; Conversations. I was on a panel of single and married men put together by me friend and host Nicole. We talked about what men are looking for in a partner.BTW, both of these you can find on YouTube.My takeaway from both convo was that you have to learn how to be grounded in yourself and beliefs (values/morales).&nbsp;&nbsp;This post is more directed at the entrepreneurs who who brand is more dependent on them sharing their #IntellectualCapital.I explain the why in the vlog.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoer #PoverB #TodayisANewDay
