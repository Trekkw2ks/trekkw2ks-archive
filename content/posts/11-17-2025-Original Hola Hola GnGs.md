11.17.25Original:Hola Hola G&amp;Gs &#128406;&#127998;,Unintentionally, Monday night's #Trekkw2ksLive nearly ran 2 hours. Largely in part because folks were talking me up in the live chat. Leading to multiple tangents. I don't have the largest audience but I have some smart and funny folks and I appreciate them all.The result, a 2 for 1 covering&nbsp; crypto mining and the crypto vote.Bitfarms is the first domino to fall by exiting crypto mining. The company plans to pivot into Ai and #HPC infrastructure by having all its facilities retrofitted with Nvidia processors by 2027.&nbsp;With rising energy prices, the rollback of green energy incentives, and more states tighting up crypto mining legislation, it only makes sense for bean counters, the juice isn't worth the squeeze anymore.Big pro for garage/basement miners, the difficulty rate drops with that many miners going off line. Some will make it to local retail market but most with be dumped overseas at wholesale.&nbsp;The takeaway, more #WallStDaddy connected miners join the new grift, playing with AI. Opaic funds will be secured to retrofit facilities and purchase the lastest and greatest processors. But it's all smoke and mirror to prop up the market for Nvidia.Moving on to the second takeaway.Apparently, Nigel Farage (leader of the Reform UK party) is starting is campaign for prime minister early. Elections aren't untill 2029. The more interesting part is how he's following our nation's commandor and chief of the grifters by shilling the Bank of England set up Bitcoins reserve.&nbsp; Also, like Trump, he's anti-CBDC and catering to the #CryptoVote.&nbsp;But who's that? Promise, it's not who you think it is.&nbsp;Takeaway two, the crypto vote demographic isn't the average Joe Jane with a Coinbase account. 22 year old cypto degans hoping to moon a meme coin, or a retiree who has no clue how their pension fund is involved in crypto. Farage is a politician after all. His campaign is signaling to UK's TradFi and high networth individuals while using pro-Bitcoin language.&nbsp;&nbsp;All I can say is you have another 3 years to see the bollocks we do in the states. Take notes UK.PS: Words cast spells. MAGA supporters wholeheartedly believed the words used by Trump during campaign trail. Now look at them less than 1 years in. Again, take notice UK.#Trekkw2ks #ScratchMyBrain #TrustedAI #HPC #AI #CBDC #CryptoMining&nbsp;AI version : Perplexity&nbsp;Hola Hola G&amp;Gs &#128406;&#127998;,Unintentionally, Monday night's #Trekkw2ksLive nearly ran 2 hours. That was mostly because the live chat was lively, sparking a lot of tangents. I may not have the biggest following, but my community is smart, funny, and always keeps me on my toes. I appreciate them all.The result? A two-for-one episode covering crypto mining trends and the emergence of the crypto vote.1️⃣ Bitfarms: The First Domino FallsBitfarms is the first major miner to exit the crypto mining arena, announcing plans to pivot into AI and HPC (high-performance computing) infrastructure. The company will retrofit all its facilities with Nvidia processors by 2027.With energy prices rising, green energy incentives being rolled back, and states tightening crypto mining regulations, it&rsquo;s clear why the numbers no longer add up&mdash;it just isn&rsquo;t worth the squeeze for large operations.But here&rsquo;s a positive for garage and basement miners: as major players go offline, overall mining difficulty drops. Some of that retired hardware will hit the retail market, creating opportunities for smaller operators.The bigger picture? More &ldquo;Wall St Daddy&rdquo;-connected firms will jump on the next wave, securing opaque funding to retrofit facilities and acquire the latest processors. But it&rsquo;s all smoke and mirrors to prop up the market for Nvidia.2️⃣ The Crypto Vote and Political TheaterOn the political front, Nigel Farage (leader of the Reform UK party) is already starting his campaign for prime minister&mdash;even though elections aren&rsquo;t until 2029. What&rsquo;s really interesting is how he&rsquo;s following our own commander-in-chief of grifters by promoting the idea of the Bank of England building a Bitcoin reserve. Like Trump, Farage is anti-CBDC and actively courting the #CryptoVote.But make no mistake: the &ldquo;crypto vote&rdquo; demographic isn&rsquo;t just your average Coinbase user, a 22-year-old crypto degen hoping to moon a meme coin, or retirees who might not realize their pension funds are exposed to crypto. Farage&rsquo;s campaign is sending signals to the UK&rsquo;s TradFi sector and high-net-worth individuals, using pro-Bitcoin language as cover.You&rsquo;ve got three years, UK&mdash;watch closely to see the kind of bollocks we do in the States and take notes.PS: Words cast spells. MAGA supporters wholeheartedly believed the words Trump used on the campaign trail&mdash;and look at them now, less than 1 year in. Take notice, UK.#Trekkw2ks #ScratchMyBrain #TrustedAI #HPC #AI #CryptoMining
