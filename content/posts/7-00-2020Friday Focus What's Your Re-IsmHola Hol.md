7-00-2020Friday Focus: What's Your Re-Ism?Hola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's #vlog is based on something that was said during the Blockchain &amp; Booze event. I don't remember who started it, but I think it was @Naj.She asked the group considering everything going on, how they would apply the prefix #REto a word. I'm paraphrasing this all but words like reunit, retoll, and reenergize were shared.The connection #ThinkersandDoers, this coming decade will bring all types of re-isms, especially being a entrepreneur. The panelists highlighted that we have to push forward, think with intention, and not let the uncertain time detour us by only thinking negative.#hhimtrekk #fridayfocus #realtalk #thinkpositive #stayfocused #wordshavepower #whatsyourism #2020aintready #PoverB #talkischeap #innovation #thinkabout&nbsp;
