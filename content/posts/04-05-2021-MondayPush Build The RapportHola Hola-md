04-05-2021#MondayPush: Build The RapportHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is a topic I've covered before. So, I guess this is more of a reminder about how business relationships don't develop from just one meeting with a person. It takes years sometimes to find a project that brings people together.This is me and the #PointyHairGuy aka @samson also acknowledged (by me) as my unofficial mentor. We met a while ago in #DC and kept in contact. Take a look at our @linkedin or @twitter SoMe1(Social Media) content. You'll see that we have regular interactions covering topics of #cryptos, #crowdfunding, and this thing called the #SpaceEconomy.The point, I took the time to build a rapport and help to amplify his #brandecho (he still doesn't believe me). Thanks to investing the time, energy, and effort. I did an informational about #NFTs to someone he referred to me this past #eastersunday. And the #HustleFundBaby retained me to make his first NFT. BTW, that will be on @wax.io.As Samson said on closing the deal "off to the races". More details to come.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkgersnDoers #Checkin #PoverB #SXSW
