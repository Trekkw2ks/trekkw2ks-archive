06-25-2021#FridayFocus: Living The DreamHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Today's vlog is based on a @Samson twitt. He basically said that 99% of people don't pursue their dreams.As it relates to this entrepreneurship thing, most people take "#livingthedream" as a net positive from the start.&nbsp;TBC, this isn't just a generational mindset. I will admit it seems to be more acceptable these (impart thanks to SoMe &#128542;) to look like a boss without putting in the work required to live the dream.It's a mix bag of ups and downs. And I can see why most people don't make it.The point to it all is you can't live the dream without putting in some level of work.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB&nbsp;Posted 06-28-2021
