02.17.2022Hola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;,Todays post is from the cold as snow covered city of Denver. Not gonna lie when I got off the ✈️ last night and saw out side. I had to wonder why did I leave a place with less ❄️ for this &#129318;&#127998;&zwj;♂️.The things we do to build our network, lol n smh.Nonetheless, I'm here and looking to buy a few ☕ and shake hands. If luck is on my side, I'll get a crypto jobs list swag from Michelle LaI &#129310;&#127998;.Bruce I hope your feeling better. And Raina, hope we can still catch up.The clock is ticking. I have less than 72 hours to get out of dodge.Btw, that's me waiting on a Lyft. Holy shyt was it expensive.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersandDoers #EthDenver #NetworkBuildinglink
