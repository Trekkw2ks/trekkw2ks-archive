4-21-2020Tuesday Brand: Brand Dev Pt 3Hola Hola G&amp;Gs&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's vlog is pt 3 of understanding your brand (yes, you have a brand.) And for some (3+ yrs of running) it's clarifying what that voice/message is.The 3rd question is HOW are you helping? Meaning, what methods or tactics are you using to help them reach WHAT you promised to provide?&nbsp;As I've been saying since being in Joburg, if you want to increase you chances of making it through this Corona period, you'll have to pivot your business. Some will make small changes while others will make a 180&deg; change.I know for me, it's not a complete 180 because I'm still focused on the blockchain/crypto space, but it is a pivot for sure. IAH, I see this as a silverlining of covid-19. I really don't know how long it would've taken to get to this point with the company without the pandemic.Nonetheless, I hope these vlogs are helping or at least getting you to think about how to move your business forward.hhimtrekk tuesdaybrand help dizdev brandbuilding RUready thinkaboutit breakingthenoise ThinkersnDoers PoverB CoPiv
