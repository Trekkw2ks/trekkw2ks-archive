04-01-2021#ThursdayBlackness:&nbsp;John BelizaireHola Hola GnGs ,Today's raised fist and hand clap goes to John Belizaire. He is the&nbsp;CEO of Soluna, whose main office is based in NYC. The basic idea is to use wind energy and other #renwableenergies to run the computing power needed in cryptocurrency mining in addition to other applications.I think this is a great idea.&nbsp; And the company is already using wind in #Morocco. Also, this helps put to rest the whole crypto mining uses dirty energy. I wonder if this would work in a country like Lesotho?Anywho, I just want to say thank you Mr Melizaire. Your contribution to the blockchain industry shows, black people are more than consumers of technology. I'd like to make it to #Africa again to see how you've scaled.#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB
