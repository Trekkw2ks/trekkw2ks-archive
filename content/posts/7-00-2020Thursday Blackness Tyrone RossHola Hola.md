7-00-2020Thursday Blackness: Tyrone RossHola Hola G&amp;Gs,&nbsp;Today's raisedfist and hattip goes to @tyroneross. I came across him by way of @Anthony pomp podcast. I was impressed by his honesty and willingness to say the things that make people uncomfortable but are addressing the core of financial education and the economic wealth gap.Thank you again sir for putting me onto the book The Color of Money by Mehrsa baradaran. It connected a lot of the historical dots for me about why black wealth is where it is.I enjoy your walk about vlogs. And look forward to meeting you one day IRL.@hhimtrekk ThursdayBlackness SoMe podcast twitter realtalk #401storytelling blacksintech blacksinblockchain FA financialadvisor innovators blackownedbusinesses influencers creators PoverB #2020aintready ThinkersnDoers&nbsp;
