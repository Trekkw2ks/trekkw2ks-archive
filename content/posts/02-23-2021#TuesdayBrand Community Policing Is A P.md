02-23-2021#TuesdayBrand: Community Policing Is A Part Of #BrandEchoHola Hola GnGs ,Today's vlog is something I thought of this morning while driving in to my unit. It's based on post I made about Alex ministry of celsius.I think more CEOs need to take note on how he interacts with his community and the #cryptospace in general.&nbsp;He does regular #AMAs. I'd argue this level of interaction helps reinforces #commuitypolicing and helps build #BrandEcho.How you ask?&nbsp;Well by talking directly with end users of @celsius it helps to cut down on #FUD. And in turn they are better to police the community of bad actors and warn about companies using questionable practices.I cover a lil more in the vlog about this aspect of #NetworkEffect.#Trekkw2Ks #TransparencyPays #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB
