12-25-2021Friday Focus: Be Safe &amp; In Good CompanyHola Hola GnGs &#128075;&#127998;,Today's vlog is the first one to land on a Christmas. I'm don't celebrate it these days. But I know a number of you&nbsp;#ThinnkersnDoers&nbsp;do.So #MerryChristmas and happy holidays to those folks. For the rest of you (myself included), I hope your in a safe space and enjoying good company.The vlog didn't go as planned in part because I had no plan, lol. But I do know at some point it will be what someone needs to hear.&nbsp;Your welcome.While writing this, I thought about something @samson has mentioned a number of times. People always ask, how you become successful? But the real question should be WHAT did you sacrifice to be successful. Because the overnight success (really 10yrs) doesn't come without.For this #Xmas2020, I'm being half lazy and editing these ebooks.I talk about it more in the vlog.#hhimtrekk #FridayFocus #2021IsAlmostHere #PoverB #trekkw2ks
