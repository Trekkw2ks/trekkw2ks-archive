05-10-2021#MondayPush: Not Fitting The MoldHola Hola GnGs &#128406;&#127998;&#128104;&#127998;&zwj;&#127908;,Today's vlog is based on a youtube livestream over the weekend by my #BroBro Kenn boask. Not to be confused with Kenneth ba. During the stream he discovered being listed as the 4th highest grossing NFT creator on link.Congrats to the you bro!!! &#127881;&#127801;&#128079;&#127998;So, why do I mention his unintended accomplishment? Because Kenn is the perfect example of how you don't have to fit the mold of "a professional" to be successful.&nbsp;I tell people all the time, he is the #MayorofCrypto and a guerrellia marketing genius when it comes to the crypto space. But most folks can't get pass the tattoos and long hair. Inturn missing out on the wealth of knowledge he has and his network.The point, being the "odd ball" and not fitting the mold is ok. It doesn't stop you from being successful.#Trekkw2ks #PoverB #ThinkersnDoers&nbsp;
