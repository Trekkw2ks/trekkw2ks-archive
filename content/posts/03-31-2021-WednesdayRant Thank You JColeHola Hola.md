03-31-2021#WednesdayRant: Thank You JColeHola Hola GnGs ,I saw this #JCole song (Middle Child) in my feed over the weekend and it made me think about a few things. First, Cole is one of my favorite rappers and the beat was hot. @tamara I'm taking a lesson from you and sharing the youtube link for those interested.To be clear, I'm not saying I'm living the life or have the same levels of woes of people working to build their career in the rap industry.However, the song does remind me to stay in my lane for what I'm looking to do in the crypto space...I doubt JCole would ever see this vlog. But I am thankful for the song. I'm not trying to be mister popular.&nbsp;I'm not doing what others are doing and that's ok. I want to see other build, grow, and shine.&nbsp;#Trekkw2ks #ThinkersnDoers #PoverB #BrandEcholink
