01-24-2021So I'll be honest, I don't remember who requested who first. But I'm glad we are connected be connected with you @keirs. Over the years (I think 2 now), I've learned a number of things from your walking in the woods vlogs while explaining really technical things.And this is why I got your book, Move Over Brokers, Here Comes Blockchain. I must admit, I'm a very slow reader. So, I cheated and made your ebook into an audio book. Considering how much I like your content. I will more than likely buy the audio book when though I already hear your voice when listening to my version.I must say, what a brain you have. That entrance exam story about making snakes out of squiggly lines shows your creativity to think out the box. If that examiner could see you now, lol.Admittedly, I'm still short of the half-way mark of the book. So, far I like how you've broken down the basics of what makes a blockchain work. I like the market metaphor for ZKSnark. I enjoyed the build up about the security faults of the tech industry as a whole. And the part about making C suite level folks have to donate a kidney when their company has a data leak made me chuckle. You're breakdown of multifactor authentication is simple with practical concern.I look forward to finishing the book sir.#trekkw2ks #blockchiantechnology #cybersecurity
